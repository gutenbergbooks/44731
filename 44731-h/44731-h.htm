<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> little Egyptian cousins are the descendants
of one of the most ancient races on earth,
but they are very wide-awake to-day in more
ways than one.</p>

<p>Little Egyptian boys and girls are as keen and
bright as their cousins of any land, and though
their religion is that of Mohammed, the same as
of our little Arabian cousins, their principles are
most upright and correct.</p>

<p>Of recent years many, many thousands of
little American and English cousins have visited
the banks of the Nile, and frequent intercourse
with strangers has given our little Egyptian
cousins a very broad and intelligent outlook on
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>They have learned scraps of English, and
indeed French and German too, almost unconsciously,
and if the donkey boys of Cairo and
the other great tourist resorts are keen little fellows
in their efforts to get coins from strangers,
they are equally desirous of pleasing and give
good value for their money.</p>

<p>The Egyptians of to-day are a cleanly, progressive
people, and if they prefer donkey or
camel back in preference to automobiles and
railways as a means of travel it is because
their country is not as yet developed to its full
possibilities.</p>

<p>Some day things will be different, for the railway
on land, steamboats on the Nile, and electric
cars running from Cairo to the Great Pyramids
are bound to somewhat change things.</p>

<p>It is safe to say, however, that for long years
to come little American cousins visiting Egypt
will look upon riding donkeys and camels and
sailing upon the queer dahabeahs on the Nile as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
one of the pleasantest recollections of this old
historic land. If, too, they can make such warm
friends of their little Egyptian cousins as did
George and his uncle Ben the people of modern
Egypt will remain ever in their hearts as the
kindest, most likable of folk.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<br />
<small>NABUL AND HIS LITTLE WHITE DONKEY</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Hi-yah!</span> Hi-yah! Who will ride on
Nabul's little donkey,&mdash;the swiftest donkey in
all the great city of Cairo?" called out a shrill,
clear voice. Through the crowded street there
clattered a little white donkey and on his back
was a small boy, laughing merrily and waving
a short stick in one hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, look to thy face! Oh, look to thy
heels! Oh, make way for me, good people!"
cried the little boy as he guided his donkey skilfully
through the crowd by taps with his heels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>As the donkey pushed his way along, everybody
laughed good-naturedly, and stepped
aside.</p>

<p>"'Tis only that imp of mischief, Nabul, and
his donkey," they would say as they made way
for the little rider, for everybody knew and liked
little Nabul Ben Hassan, the youngest donkey
boy in Cairo.</p>

<p>Presently the donkey trotted around a corner
and nearly upset a little table of cakes, beside
which sat an old man fast asleep. "Plague on
thee, dost thou not yet know how to drive a
donkey?" grumbled the old fellow, who woke
up just in time to save his cakes.</p>

<p>"Nay, father, 'tis thou who knowst not how
to sell cakes, for thou wast fast asleep, while the
flies ate the sugar from thy cakes without paying
for it," answered Nabul. This made the passers-by
laugh, for Nabul was a great favourite in the
quarter, and the old cake-seller was not, for
sometimes he tried to cheat them when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
came to buy his round, brown cakes covered all
over with honey.</p>

<p>Nabul now hurried on the faster. He was
anxious to reach the square where all the donkey
boys of the city were to be found at noon, for he
had a great piece of news to tell his chum Abdal,
who would be sure to be there.</p>

<p>Nabul had just come from the big hotel in the
main street where, along with all the other donkey
boys, he liked to trot his little donkey up
and down the street in front of the veranda, or
terrace, of the hotel, hoping to attract the attention
of those strange-speaking people who came
from over the seas to see his country and to ride
on the little Egyptian donkeys.</p>

<p>Indeed, truth to tell, the donkey boys thought
the strangers came to Egypt just for that purpose,
and out of compliment to the travellers,
and with an eye to business, many of the boys
named their donkeys after the great people of
the various countries. There was a "King Edward"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and a "Chamberlain" and a "Lord
Cromer," to please the English, and another
donkey was named after the French President
"Fallieres," while Nabul himself called his
"Teddy,"&mdash;you all know who that is,&mdash;and
he usually called him "Teddy Pasha," because
Pasha means, in his language, a great man.</p>

<p>Nabul already knew about America, that big
country so far away, for did he not have an uncle
who had been a "donkey boy" in "The Streets
of Cairo" at the great Chicago Exposition, and
was even now at a place called Coney Island?
This uncle wrote him letters full of tales of wonderful
doings, and did he not know also two of
the oldest donkey boys now in Cairo who had
been to the big Exposition in America?</p>

<p>Little Nabul never tired of listening to the
marvellous tales they brought back with them,
and in this way he came to know how to tell the
Americans from the other strangers who visited
Cairo, as he watched them sitting on the broad
terrace of the hotel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the Americans who laughed and joked
the most with the little donkey boys. Often,
too, if they happened to be in a very good
humour, they would throw them <i>milliemes</i>, the
smallest of Egyptian coins, and then such a
scramble as went on among the boys down in
the street as each tried to get a coin. This would
only make the visitors laugh the more, when
they would scatter more coins.</p>

<p>"What a country must be that from whence
these strangers come," thought Nabul to himself,
"that one can throw away money like that!
How I should like to go there! Perhaps we will
some day, Teddy Pasha. I won't go without
thee," he went on, tapping the little donkey
gently with his heels, as he sat proudly on his
back. He was turning all this over in his mind
to-day as he rode to find his cousin Abdal, who
was most probably taking his midday rest with
the other donkey boys.</p>

<p>When he reached the square it was noon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Here, in the shade of the locust and mimosa
trees which bordered the square, stood dozens
of donkeys of all sizes and colours,&mdash;white and
brown and black and gray donkeys,&mdash;with
bright-coloured saddles and blankets, and on
their bridles and around their necks were strings
of little jingling bells.</p>

<p>There are a great many donkeys in Egypt,
for almost everybody uses a donkey on which to
get about, and for that reason there are so many
donkey boys who make a business of hiring out
their clever little animals.</p>

<p>Some of the donkeys were fast asleep,&mdash;that
is, they had their eyes tight shut, but one can
never tell when a donkey is shamming; others
were looking very wise out of the corners of their
eyes, but it may have been that they were only
planning how to dodge their work, or wondering
if they could rub their saddles off against the
tree-trunks, and thus give their young masters
a little trouble. No one can possibly guess what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
a donkey is thinking about, though it is safe to
say that Egyptian donkeys, like donkeys the
world over, are generally up to mischief.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the young owners of the donkeys
were stretched out on the ground in the shade.
Some were playing a game like knuckle-bones;
others were eating their lunch of honey cakes
and dates, but all were chattering away at the
top of their voices like so many magpies.</p>

<p>"Ho, here comes the little one!" they all
cried out as Nabul rode up, sliding off his donkey
and dropping down beside a boy a little
older than himself. Meanwhile his little white
donkey made at once for the bunch of his fellows
and began pushing them about without ceremony,
in order to make room for himself in the
shade. This of course ended in a great braying
and biting of ears, and the boys had to jump up
and lay about them with their sticks before order
was restored.</p>

<p>"Thy Pasha is like one possessed of an evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
spirit," said one of the boys as he went back to
his game.</p>

<p>"Nay, he is but masterful; see, he obeys one
without the stick. Come here, little dove,"
called Nabul, who whistled to the little donkey
who wriggled his long ears and came as meek as
a lamb and stood by the side of his master.</p>

<p>"Abdal," said Nabul eagerly in a low voice
to his companion lying in the shade, "I have
good news for you. As I came by the big hotel
I saw Mustapha, the dragoman, and he told me
that it might be that he would want our donkeys
to-morrow. There are two strangers at the hotel
who have taken him for their dragoman. They
have come from America in a big white ship to
Alexandria, after many days on the ocean, and
they are to stay a long time in our country.
Mustapha is to be their guide, and if they want
donkeys to ride Mustapha will see that they hire
ours," and here Nabul paused for breath.</p>

<p>"Of a truth they will want donkeys, does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
not every one who comes to Cairo take a donkey
ride through the bazaars and under the trees of
the broad avenue leading out to the great pyramids?"
demanded Abdal, sitting up and becoming
as excited as his friend.</p>

<p>"Yes, but these strangers want to do more
than that, for Mustapha says they may stay in
our country for many weeks. One of these
strangers is a boy like ourselves, and did you
ever hear of a boy walking when he could
ride?" asked Nabul triumphantly.</p>

<p>"But this boy may be different," said Abdal
doubtfully; "however, if Mustapha has promised&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, he has," interrupted Nabul, "so
to-morrow we must take care to be the first to
show ourselves before them."</p>

<p>The two boys talked it over awhile longer
as they ate their bread and dates and bit of
cheese which they each took from a big pocket
inside their long gowns. Abdal then ran across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the square and bought a melon from a fruit merchant
who sat there on a round, straw mat with
his stock of melons heaped about him. After
they had finished this the two cousins mounted
and galloped away, each in a different direction.</p>

<p>Nabul and Teddy Pasha did some business
that afternoon, carrying a few people up and
down the busy streets in the centre of the city,
but in such an absent-minded fashion on Nabul's
part that he very nearly let the Pasha rub a fat
old gentleman, who was riding him, off against
a wall. The streets in the older part of Cairo
are very, very narrow and crooked.</p>

<p>Usually it was quite dark when Nabul came
home in the evening, but to-day he was anxious
to tell the good news to his mother and the little
sisters, so at sundown he and Teddy Pasha
turned toward home.</p>

<p>As the little donkey trotted into the narrow
street by the river where he and Nabul lived,
Nabul's two little sisters came running to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
them. They had been watching for their brother
as was their habit every evening, for often if he
and Teddy were not too tired when they got
home, they would be given a little canter to the
end of the street and back, and they knew also
that there were usually cakes or sweets in
Nabul's pockets for them.</p>

<p>Nabul was very fond of his little sisters and
good to them, better than little Egyptian boys
often are to little girls; and as for the two little
girls, they thought there was nobody in Cairo
like their big brother.</p>

<p>The little girls were dressed in long blue
cotton gowns and each wore a black veil wound
around her head and hanging down to her waist.
One of their greatest pleasures was to go out
into the crowded city with Nabul, for they seldom
went far away from their home by themselves.</p>

<p>This evening they hung close to their brother
as he led Teddy into his stable, which was on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
ground floor of the house. Nabul laughed as
he caught Zaida peeping into his pocket. "Yes,
I have brought thee a sweet morsel," he said,
taking a little stick out of his pocket, on which
were threaded a row of small cakes, "but I
have brought you something better than sweetmeats,
a piece of good fortune&mdash;maybe it may
mean new dresses&mdash;who knows?" and he ran
up the stairs laughing, with the little girls close
behind and asking all sorts of questions.</p>

<div class="caption">NABUL WITH HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS.</div>
</div>

<p>Thus they tumbled into the big family living-room
quite out of breath. "Thou makest noise
enough for a small army, my children," said
their mother, who was setting out the evening
meal. "Thou art home early, my son, but all
must be well, for thou art merry."</p>

<p>"He has a secret and will not tell it to us,
mother," cried Menah, the eldest sister.</p>

<p>"Now you shall hear it, I waited to tell the
mother first," said Nabul as he told his story of
the strangers who wanted to engage two donkeys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and their drivers for, as he hoped, many
weeks.</p>

<p>"It would seem, indeed, to be the hand of
good fortune which is held out toward thee,"
said the mother Mizram.</p>

<p>They all sat around on the floor, which was
covered with matting, and Mizram gave each
one a thin, flat sort of pancake made of corn
meal well browned. This was their plate, and
on it she heaped up a stew of mutton and big red
peppers fried in oil. Children are never too
happy nor too excited to eat, but between each
mouthful they talked their prospects over and
over again, and were only sorry to think that
their father was not here, too, to hear the good
news. Nabul's father, Mahomet Ben Hassan,
was the captain of a dahabeah, an Egyptian
sailing boat, which carried merchandise and
native passengers up and down the river Nile.
He was away now on a trip and would not be
home again for a week or more. An Egyptian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
household is very industrious, and every one of
a suitable age and state of health is always very
much occupied. Soon even the little girls would
be taught to embroider, and their work would
be sold to some merchant in the great Bazaar,
and he in turn would sell it to strangers at, of
course, a much higher price than the little girls
would get for their labour.</p>

<p>When the girls had eaten the cakes that Nabul
had brought them and some fruit, they sat in
the big window that overlooked the river, and
Abdal came in and sat with them until bedtime.
Abdal's home was on a farm near Cairo, but
since he had become a donkey boy he lived
with friends just at the top of the street.</p>

<p>The little girls and their mother slept on a
broad cot in the back room, up against the wall
which was hung with matting to keep off the
chill, but Nabul just rolled himself up in a
woollen coverlid and slept on the hard matted
floor, just as soundly, too, as he would have done
in a soft bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>As you may imagine, little Nabul did not
oversleep the next morning. He was up with a
bound as soon as he heard the call of the old
muezzin from the little gallery of a near-by
mosque, for that meant it was time for every one
to get up and say his morning prayers and begin
the work of the day. All over Cairo are found
these Mohammedan places of worship, and from
their towers and minarets, five times a day, the
muezzin's call to prayer serves the people for a
town clock.</p>

<p>"Thou must put on thy best clothes to-day,"
said Nabul's mother, as she opened a low
wooden box painted green with red and gold
decorations. This was Nabul's own particular
trunk, and from it was taken his best suit. Instead
of the blue cotton gown which Nabul usually
wore, he to-day put on a white one that had
pretty yellow silk stripes in it, tying it in with a
broad red silk sash at his waist. After this he
stuck his little turban jauntily on the side of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
head so that its long black tassel hung right
down over one eye, but he did not seem to mind
this in the least.</p>

<p>"There will not be another donkey boy in
Cairo as fine as thee," said little Zaida, clapping
her hands, while Menah stuffed in her brother's
pocket a piece of sweet bread and some dates
wrapped in a handkerchief for his lunch. Nor
did she forget a couple of morsels of sugar for
Teddy Pasha.</p>

<p>Nabul now rushed down-stairs to the stable,
the Pasha neighing good morning to him as he
heard his little master come in the door. Nabul
brushed and rubbed the little donkey down until
his coat was as fine and glossy as a little donkey's
coat could be. Then he dusted off the gaily coloured
blanket and threw it over Teddy Pasha's
back, and strapped on the high padded red
saddle, after which, catching the bridle, hung
with red tassels and little bells in his hand, he
sprang on his back, Teddy looking back at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
little master and wiggling his ears as though he
quite approved of everything that had been done.</p>

<p>"Now be off, little dove, we are fine enough
for the Khedive himself," said Nabul, waving a
good-bye with his stick to the home folks, and
riding away to join Abdal, who was just then
leading his donkey out of its stable door near by.</p>

<p>"Art thou ready?" cried Nabul as he came
up to his cousin. Abdal nodded and mounted
quickly, and away went the two boys laughing
and shouting and calling out pet names to their
donkeys as they galloped along.</p>

<p>Soon the boys had left the narrow winding
streets of old Cairo behind them, and were
trotting past the beautiful gardens and through
the wide thoroughfares where are only the fine
modern houses and big hotels. Finally they
halted in front of the great hotel where the
strangers were staying.</p>

<p>Early as it was, there was a crowd of natives
standing on the sidewalk and gathered about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the steps leading from the broad terrace to the
street. All of them were hoping to attract the
attention of the guests of the hotel, some of whom
were already eating their breakfasts at little
tables set about on the terrace.</p>

<p>There were beggars of all sorts asking alms,
and street peddlers with their wares well displayed.
Some of these were loaded down with
heavy rugs and draperies, others had their arms
full of gold and silver embroideries, or tinsel
knickknacks of all kinds. There were snake-charmers
and musicians and jugglers too. It
was like a circus or a county fair. There were
the dragomans, as the guides are called, in a
group all by themselves, looking as if they owned
the earth, as they swaggered grandly up and
down the pavement dressed in their handsome
silk clothes. No wonder they felt proud, for
they were a big, fine-looking lot of fellows, and
most of them spoke many languages. Our two
little friends looked at them with admiration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
for you must know it is the ambition of every
donkey boy to become a dragoman himself
some day.</p>

<p>In spite of the haste of our little friends, there
were already other donkey boys ahead of them.
These were gathered about a tall dragoman who
stood leaning against the railings smoking his
cigarette and paying not a bit of attention to
them.</p>

<p>"There is Mustapha, the dragoman," whispered
Nabul to his friend, pointing to the group;
"he too has on his beautiful new clothes."</p>

<p>"Yes, and see how those other fellows stick
close to him, like flies around a honey jar,"
answered Abdal.</p>

<p>"Aha! they well know that Mustapha is the
most popular dragoman in Cairo, and they hope
that he will hire their donkeys," answered
Nabul.</p>

<p>Our two little friends now slipped off their
donkeys and ran up to the big dragoman, crying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
"We are here, oh, Mustapha! send away
these others."</p>

<p>This made the other boys clamour all the
louder. Meanwhile Mustapha paid not the
slightest attention to any of them, but went on
puffing away at his cigarette, for Egyptians have
the bad habit of smoking one of these nasty
little cigarettes at nearly all times.</p>

<p>Mustapha did indeed look gorgeous. He had
on a bright green silk garment and over this a
pale yellow silk gown; a rich red sash was
wound round his waist many times and around
his head was rolled the folds of a great silken
turban of white and gold.</p>

<p>"Thou will want us, oh, Mustapha?" questioned
Nabul at last in a whisper, giving Mustapha's
sleeve a tug to remind the great man
that they were still there.</p>

<p>"Who can tell? Allah alone knows the mind
of these strangers," answered the dragoman,
finally. "It may be that they will even want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to ride in one of those evil-smelling flying carriages,"
he continued, throwing a scornful
glance at a big automobile that just at that moment
came to a halt beside them, one of the few
to be seen in Egypt.</p>

<p>It is true that there are even automobiles in
Egypt, and every dragoman and donkey boy is
very jealous of them, for they are afraid that if
there are too many automobiles, people will not
ride on their camels and donkeys.</p>

<p>"Who would not rather ride on a beautiful
donkey like mine than in one of those noisy,
smelly things?" said Abdal, patting his little
donkey's head.</p>

<p>"Hush, here come the two strangers," whispered
Abdal, as a little boy, followed by a tall
gentleman, came out on to the terrace.</p>

<p>But Mustapha's quick eye had seen them,
and forgetting his lofty manners he tossed away
his cigarette and was smiling and bowing down
to the ground when the little American boy ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
up to him, crying: "Here is our dragoman,
isn't he splendid, and look at all the little
donkeys! Oh, do let us take a donkey ride
right now, Uncle Ben," he went on eagerly,
"wouldn't that be lots of fun, so much better
than tramping about as we did yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's the thing to do when one comes to
Egypt, so perhaps we had better try it if you
think I can find a donkey high enough to keep
my feet off the ground," said the tall gentleman,
looking the little donkeys over.</p>

<p>All the donkey boys saw that he was talking
about them, and pressed eagerly around, waving
their sticks wildly, and each calling out that
his was the best and fastest donkey in Cairo,
and there was no other like him in all the world.</p>

<p>Little Nabul, with his arm over the Pasha's
neck, called out as loudly as any of them, but
his heart sank when he saw the little American
put his hand on the bridle of one of the other
donkeys standing near him. What chance had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
he among so many big fellows? And suppose
Mustapha forgot his promise, after all! Mustapha
was so busy talking to the tall gentleman
that he paid no attention to the boys.</p>

<p>At that moment a big donkey boy pushed
Nabul so roughly to one side that both he and
Teddy Pasha came very near tumbling between
the long legs of a great wobbly camel that was
just coming down the street laden with big
sacks of grain hung across the humps on his
back.</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself to hit
a little fellow like that," cried the little American
boy, who had seen it all. "You are twice as big
as he."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nabul had recovered his balance
with tears of anger and mortification in his eyes.
His pretty suit was splashed with mud, and the
end of the rough, heavy sack that was slung
across the camel's back had badly scratched the
Pasha's saddle. With his heart almost bursting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
with grief and rage he went at the big boy with
Abdal close behind him. If he could only give
him a good whack with his stick!</p>

<p>"That's right, go for him," shouted the little
American excitedly, rushing down the steps,
"I'll help you out!" For a minute it looked as
if there would be a general fight, but Mustapha
with great dignity got between the boys and
talked so sternly in Arabic to the big one that he
was glad enough to slink away to the farther
side of the street, glad indeed that he had not got
the beating which he deserved.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the little American to
Nabul, "I will ride your donkey. I think he is
the nicest of them all, anyway."</p>

<p>Nabul did not understand all he said, but he
knew what he meant quickly enough.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he cried, "me speak American, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, can you? Then we can talk together
and we shall understand each other very well,"
cried the little American with great joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Nabul was so happy that he could only grin
and point to the Pasha. "Teddy Pasha, his
name, Teddy Pasha," he kept on saying.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Ben, his little donkey is named
Teddy; we must have him now, mustn't we?"
cried George, as our little American friend was
named.</p>

<p>"I don't imagine he can talk very much
'American' as he calls it," replied Uncle Ben,
"but Mustapha has just been telling me that
these two boys are good reliable little fellows
and advises us to take them."</p>

<p>"I am sure they are," said George, enthusiastically,
who had already made friends with
the Pasha.</p>

<p>"Well, so long as you have made up your
mind to see Egypt on donkey back, and are
going to make your staid old uncle do the same
thing, we will try these two boys and their donkeys
to-day, and if they suit us we will engage
them for the whole time we are here," said his
uncle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you will be sure to like it, Uncle Ben,"
said George coaxingly; but he well knew that
his uncle would do anything to please him, even
to riding on a jolting donkey over the rough
streets of Cairo.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<br />
<small>A DONKEY RIDE AROUND CAIRO</small></h2>


<p><span class='smcap'>After</span> it was all arranged, and Nabul and
Abdal were actually sure that they were to be
hired, they were so happy that they did not know
whether they were standing on their heads or
heels.</p>

<p>"Well, mount your steed, George, and we
will be off," said the tall gentleman, George's
uncle, Mr. Benjamin Winthrop. Mr. Winthrop
had already mounted Abdal's donkey, hunching
up his knees so that his feet would not touch the
ground, so George clambered up on Teddy
Pasha's high red saddle and the little donkey
started off at a lively trot without waiting for a
tap from Nabul's stick. Away went the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
party down the street, the two Egyptian boys
running along, each by the side of his donkey,
crying out so as to clear the road ahead, and
every now and again giving the donkeys a gentle
stroke with their sticks, not to make them go
faster, but to guide them. They gave them first
a tap on one side and then on the other, as
they wanted them to go to the left or right.</p>

<p>"My! but they bounce you about," called
out George to his uncle. It was the first time he
had ever ridden a donkey and he was holding
on for dear life for fear he would be shaken
off.</p>

<p>"These Egyptian donkeys have got a funny
sort of trot, but it's all right when you once get
used to it," said Uncle Ben. "It's a bit rough
at first, but just sit easy and you will soon swing
into the motion."</p>

<p>So George tried to <i>look</i>, at least, as if he felt
easy. Now they had left the new part of the
city, frequented by the foreigners, behind them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and were entering the old city where only the
natives live.</p>

<p>Here the streets are so narrow that often the
roofs of houses nearly meet overhead, and they
are so cluttered up that it is a wonder that any
one can pass along. There were no sidewalks
and everybody walked in the middle of the
street. All the people who had any work to do
seemed to be doing it in the middle of the street,
instead of in their houses.</p>

<p>The donkeys soon had to slacken their pace,
for there was a perfect tangle of people and
donkeys and little carts, and even a two-horse
carriage tried to push through occasionally.
This gave George a chance to breathe easier,
and watch the process by which Nabul guided
the Pasha through the crowd.</p>

<p>"Keep to the right, oh, my lord!" Nabul cried
out to a richly dressed man who was crossing the
street. "Look to the left of you, oh, my
mother," he yelled to an old woman who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
bending under a great basket of bread. Little
Egyptian children usually call old women and
men by some such respectful names as "Mother"
or "Father" or "My Lord." They know well
how to address their elders.</p>

<p>Presently there was a great hubbub and
everybody made way for two tall, strong fellows
dressed in white, with gaudy red and gold embroidered
vests and red turbans, who came
running down the street shouting as they went.
Each carried a long white wand; behind them
came a handsome carriage and pair.</p>

<p>"Make way for the syces and the carriage of
the great Pasha," cried Nabul, and the little
donkeys squeezed up against the side of the
house, though even then there was barely room
for the carriage to pass.</p>

<p>George wanted to know who syces were.
Mustapha, who had accompanied the party,
explained that they were the men servants who
ran before the carriages of great personages to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
clear the way for them. They can run all day
as fast as horses can trot, and never get weary.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever get tired, either?" asked
George of Nabul as he ran along beside him.
The little Egyptian boy only laughed and shook
his head. It was funny, he thought, how all
these strangers asked him the same question
when he took them to ride. He thought nothing
of running all day long by the side of his donkey.
Egyptian children are a strong, hardy little race
of people and never seem to know what it is to
be tired. They live much in the open air and
they sleep on a hard bed, all of which tends to
make them healthy and strong.</p>

<p>"Now how on earth are we going to pass
through here?" asked George, as they turned a
corner and saw a long string of camels coming
toward them. Across each camel were slung
two great bulging sacks that nearly touched the
houses on each side.</p>

<p>"Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Jannib ya hu!" (which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
meant, "Keep to the side, oh, you!") shrieked
Nabul and Abdal to the men who had the
camels in charge. But the camels stalked along
in the middle of the way, wagging their long
necks and, of course, the donkeys had to stop,
for there was no room to pass.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/i051.jpg" width="337" height="500" alt="bazaar" />
<div class="caption">AT THE BAZAAR.</div>
</div>

<p>Such a clamour as set up! The donkey boys
screamed at the camel drivers, and the camel
men yelled back at them; while Mustapha sat
on his donkey calling the camels and their owners
all the names he could think of.</p>

<p>"One would think they were all going to
break each other's heads, wouldn't you, Uncle
Ben?" said George, beginning to get uneasy.</p>

<p>"It's only their way of settling a difficulty,
they have no idea of doing harm to any one,"
answered Mr. Winthrop. And this was true
enough. Egyptians are not as quarrelsome as
they seem. Peace was restored shortly, and the
camel drivers prodded their camels with their
sticks until they squeezed up against one side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the street, leaving just room enough for the donkeys
to get past. As it was, the last camel in the
line nipped off George's cap and Nabul had to
rescue it, but the boys only thought this a good
joke.</p>

<p>Now they were trotting through a long covered
way on either side of which were tiny shops
or booths for the sale of all sorts of wares.</p>

<p>"The Bazaar! the Bazaar where you buy
pretty things!" said Nabul, pointing to the little
booths where the merchants sat surrounded by
all sorts of merchandise, clothes to wear, furniture
and dishes to use, and good things to eat.</p>

<p>"So these are what you call stores; they look
more like boxes," exclaimed George. "Sha'n't
we stop now, Uncle Ben, and look at some of the
things?"</p>

<p>"Mustapha says we should go to the great
mosque first, and visit the Bazaars after lunch,"
called back his uncle.</p>

<p>So on went the little donkeys, climbing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
into the very oldest part of the city, called the
Citadel. Here they clattered through an ancient
gateway and soon found themselves in a
dark, gloomy street. The little donkeys went
slowly now, for it was a steep climb around and
around with high walls on either side, until at
last they came out at the very top on a sort of
terrace, overlooking the city now far below, and
there stood the great Mosque of Mohammed-Ali,
with its great central dome and slender
towers or minarets.</p>

<p>"Isn't it fine?" exclaimed George, as he
slipped off the Pasha and stood looking up at the
great building.</p>

<p>"Yes, but there are other mosques in Cairo
that are much older," answered his uncle, "but
this is the most interesting of all to see."</p>

<p>"Alabaster, all alabaster," said Nabul, laying
his hand on the stone work near the great entrance.</p>

<p>"Much of the mosque is built of pure white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
alabaster," explained Mustapha, and indeed it
is a fact that it is built of this fine white stone.
It shows plainly what good taste these old
Mohammedan builders had and what fine
workmen they were.</p>

<p>"Can't we go inside?" asked George, starting
at once for the door.</p>

<p>"Wait, the <i>babouches</i>," cried Nabul and
Abdal together, catching George by the arm and
pointing to a big pile of yellow slippers just
inside the door. These slippers, or <i>babouches</i>,
were in charge of an old man with a long white
beard and a dirty gown, and he had as assistants
two or three boys who squatted beside the
pile of footwear. On seeing the approach of
the visitors one of the boys picked out the smallest
pair of <i>babouches</i> he could find and motioned
to George to put them on over his shoes.</p>

<p>"What is that for?" asked George, bewildered.</p>

<p>"No one can enter a Mohammedan mosque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
with the shoes in which he walks the street,"
answered Mustapha. "We Mohammedans
leave ours at the door, but for the strangers there
are these slippers, or <i>babouches</i>, to be worn over
their shoes so that the sacred carpets of the
mosque may not be defiled."</p>

<p>George thought it very funny as he stuck his
feet into the big, wobbly yellow slippers. Nabul
simply shuffled out of his own little red slippers
and left them in charge of the boys at the door,
whose business it was to guard such footgear
while their owners were inside. Meanwhile
Abdal stayed behind to guard the donkeys.</p>

<p>They entered a great hall where were many
graceful columns, but the place seemed bare,
for there were no furnishings of any kind, except
that the floor was covered with rich rugs, and
from the ceiling hung hundreds of glittering
lamps. On one side was a sort of pulpit at the
top of a short flight of stairs. There were a number
of people saying their prayers in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
mosque. They would kneel and bow their
heads to the floor and stand up and raise up
their arms, all making the motions together. It
made George think of the gymnastic exercises in
his school at home.</p>

<p>"Nabul, I believe I have lost one of those
precious old slippers," said George, suddenly
looking down at his feet.</p>

<p>Nabul looked horrified when he saw George
with only one slipper on.</p>

<p>"I find," he said, and hurried back the way
they had come.</p>

<p>Mustapha turned around to see what was the
matter, and waved his arms wildly and jabbered
out a string of words when George told him what
had happened.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose they will do to me,
Uncle Ben," laughed George, "put me in prison?
It is not my fault the old slipper came off, it's
as big as a boat anyhow."</p>

<p>"I know what would have happened not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
very many years ago," answered his uncle.
"We should probably all have been mobbed,
if not killed, for it is only of recent years that
people who are not Mohammedans have been
allowed to come inside the mosques at all.
There is nothing which shows the character and
habits of the natives of Cairo better than by
observing how their religion enters into their
daily lives."</p>

<p>"It's a regular 'hunt the slipper game,'"
said George, as he watched the little Egyptian
looking carefully over the rugs.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nabul came running back with
something in his clothes.</p>

<p>"Quick, I put him on," he whispered, slipping
the missing <i>babouche</i> on George's foot, at
the same time glancing around to see that no one
was looking. No one was looking, and nothing
happened, though George wondered if that
would have been the case if he had been found
with only one slipper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>At the door they dropped the <i>babouches</i> for
good, and outside found Abdal playing games
with some boys, and the donkeys fast asleep.
They were soon waked up, and our party cantered
back to the hotel for lunch, for as George
said, "It's funny how seeing things makes you
so hungry."</p>

<p>Mustapha told the boys to be back at two
o'clock with their donkeys, but just now they
were cantering off for their own midday meal.
Nabul was in such high spirits that he must stop
and buy some hot fried peppers and a pile of
sticky sweet cakes from the man who sat under
a big red umbrella frying big red and green
peppers in a pan of olive oil which stood on a
small brazier of charcoal. It is the custom for
the sellers of vegetables and cakes to cook them
in the open air in order to attract trade by the
odours and sweet smell of the cooking.</p>

<p>The man began to ladle out some of the hot
greasy peppers. "More, more, 'tis not enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
for a coin like that," cried the boy, throwing
down a silver piece with a lofty air.</p>

<p>"Oho, thou eatest like a nobleman to-day,"
said the old man, peering at the coin. "Since
when have the donkey boys become so
rich?"</p>

<p>"There is a little American lord at the big
hotel, and I am to be his donkey boy," answered
Nabul, as he and Abdal carefully divided the
peppers between them.</p>

<p>"Umph, yes, for a ride through the Bazaar
and back again like all these stranger folk,"
said the old man as he flung some more peppers
in his pan.</p>

<p>The boys only laughed and went off to eat
their lunch in company with their companions
in the great square.</p>

<p>There were a lot of their comrades there and
they hailed our little friends at once, eager to
know all about the strangers to whom they had
hired out their donkeys, but Nabul and Abdal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
kept a discreet silence, only hinting that the
strangers were doubtless princes in their own
country. Donkey boys love to brag, but they
are apt to be a jealous lot and are on their guard
against any interference from one another.</p>

<p>One by one the boys got tired of asking questions
and dozed off curled up on the dusty
ground; but the young Egyptians did not mind
this; nor the heat, the sun was very hot even
though it was in winter; nor the swarm of flies
that buzzed around them. But little Nabul
could not sleep, he sat there thinking of the little
American, and wondering how long he would
keep him for his donkey boy.</p>

<p>If he would hire him for a long time what a lot
of money he would make, and what a lot of
things he could buy with it. He would buy himself
a new suit to wear on the last day of Ramadan,
the Mohammedans' great religious fête,
when everybody who possibly could put on new
clothes of the finest stuffs and the brightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
colours. He would buy a new saddle for Teddy
Pasha, for his present one was looking the least
bit shabby, and the scratch that it got from the
rough sack on the camel's back that morning
had not improved it in the least. The owner of
a horse or donkey in Egypt will always dress up
his steed as elaborately as his means will allow,
and never, never, if it can be helped, will he
drive him with a shabby saddle or bridle. Perhaps,
even, there would be enough to buy new
dresses for the little girls and a pair of silver
bracelets for the mother, for all Egyptian women
folk are very fond of jewelry. He would like to
buy something, too, for the father, but before he
knew it Nabul was fast asleep dreaming of untold
riches, and only awoke with a jerk when
Abdal reached over and shook him into wakefulness,
for the sun told them it was time to be
at work again.</p>

<p>George was hanging over the railing of the
terrace of the hotel on the look-out for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
as they came up, and waved his hat in the air
when he caught sight of Teddy Pasha again.</p>

<p>This time all started off towards the quarter
of the big Bazaars. Here they found many
tourists like themselves mounted on donkeys,
for everybody who comes to Cairo must take a
ride through the Bazaars where there are such
curious and beautiful things for sale. All the
same, if one was not a mere tourist, and wanted
to learn of the manners and customs of the
people, these curious streets and squares of little
shops were quite the best places in the city to
observe how hundreds and thousands of folk
gained their living in most strange ways.</p>

<p>It was funny to see the merchants run out and
hail the passers-by, and beg them to look at
their wares. One shopkeeper nearly lifted
Uncle Ben off the donkey, much to George's
amusement. Many of them were very polite,
too, and offered visitors coffee when they took
their seats on the stools in front of a shop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
The people in the Bazaar were almost as interesting
as the shops themselves. There were the
tall Egyptians of the towns and fellaheen from
the country and Bedouin Arabs from the desert
in their long, flowing white cloaks, and big black
people from the Soudan in the far South. Everybody
jabbered at once, but all spoke the same
speech. It was curious how, looking so different,
they were all practically of one race and religion.
There were also numbers of Egyptian women
all bundled up in black with white veils over
their faces, for neither the Egyptian nor Arab
women would ever think of allowing a strange
man to see their faces.</p>

<p>George had a chance to become better acquainted
with the boys while his uncle was making
some purchases. He found that not only
could they speak a little English, but some
French and a few words of Italian, too. The
little Egyptian donkey boys are remarkably
quick to catch up a foreign language. Nabul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
told him how he had learned his funny broken
English. He had first picked up words from the
tourists who rode on his donkey, and Mustapha
had taught him a good deal, for he spoke English
very well.</p>

<p>Their own speech in Arabic sounds very
strange when translated into our own tongue,
as the Egyptians, and indeed all the races which
speak Arabic, are very fond of using big words,
and they invariably express themselves in the
most formal and dignified manner. In the
evening Nabul had gone to the English school
all one year, and really he had acquired so much
English that he could chatter away as fast as the
little American, if not always so grammatically
correct.</p>

<p>So by the time they had ridden through many
more quaint streets and the beautiful Esbekiyeh
Gardens and were well on their way back the
boys were good friends.</p>

<p>"Please do tell them now that we will take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
them for our donkey boys for all the time we are
here, Uncle Ben," George whispered when they
alighted once more at the hotel.</p>

<p>"They do seem to be good obliging little
fellows, and as you are the one to be pleased,
for you will do most of the riding, I will tell
Mustapha to arrange it with them," said Mr.
Winthrop.</p>

<p>So it was settled that the services of the two
boys and their donkeys should be engaged for a
month, with the understanding that they would
be free to do business with other people if at any
time they were not needed.</p>

<p>And weren't the little Egyptians delighted!
They cried "Salaam, salaam, O gracious
Effendi!" many times, which was their way of
saying "Thank you, sir!" They strutted
through the usual crowd of donkey boys hanging
about, puffed up with pride, and were followed
by the envious glances of the other boys, for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
was not often one of their number fell in with
such a piece of good luck.</p>

<p>And how happy they all were in Nabul's home
when he rushed in with the news. The little
sisters hugged him and the mother gave him an
extra nice supper, and he went to sleep that
night dreaming that he was a big, fine dragoman
and that Teddy Pasha wore a great red turban
and could talk English.</p>

<p>Every morning bright and early Nabul and
Abdal with the donkeys, all looking as spick and
span as possible, would be waiting in front of
the hotel for the little "Effendi," as they called
George Winthrop, and when Mr. Winthrop and
George were ready away they would ride.</p>

<p>Big, fat Mustapha, jolting up and down on
his own donkey, would lead the way, and showed
them each day some of the many strange and
curious things to be seen in and around the city,
until finally George felt quite as much at home
in Cairo as did his new found friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>One day they hurried through lunch to go to
see the "Whirling Dervishes," a queer lot of
people, who spin around and around like a top,
as fast as ever they can, until they are so tired
they drop on the floor. They saw the "Howling
Dervishes," too, men in gowns of many colours,
with wild faces and long hair, whose blood-curdling
howls as they swayed themselves to and
fro almost frightened George, who could not
understand how people could possibly do such
queer things as an act of worship. These are
only two of the many sects of the Mohammedan
religion.</p>

<p>One day they crossed over to the island in the
river Nile, where Mustapha knocked at a gate
which was opened by a man in a long green
gown, and they found themselves in a garden
among trees loaded with oranges and lemons.
Here George crept behind the boys along the
top of a wall to a spot where, so the story runs,
the baby Moses was found asleep in his cradle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in the bulrushes by a daughter of the Pharaoh.
The Pharaohs were the ancient kings of Egypt.
It was most interesting for George, who was surprised
indeed to find this land of Mohammedanism
had recollections also of his own Christian
religion.</p>

<p>Another day they all rode out to a place named
Heliopolis, where long ago there was a great city
called the City of the Sun. Now only a tall
granite obelisk stands there, and any little
American can see its "twin," as George called
it, if he or she will go to New York City and look
at the big obelisk which stands in Central Park.
Once upon a time several obelisks stood side by
side at Heliopolis, but the Khedive, the ruler of
Egypt, some years ago wanted to make a valuable
present to the United States, so he gave
them one of these obelisks, the same which to-day
may be seen in New York City.</p>

<p>When they visited the great Museum Uncle
Ben and George stood amazed before the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
mummy cases and the petrified mummies themselves
(many of them the old kings of Egypt),
which have been buried for thousands of years,
and only recently been brought to light. It is
by preserving all these great finds, dug up from
the soil often in the most unexpected places,
that it has been possible to write the history of
Egypt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<br />
<small>THE BOYS CLIMB THE PYRAMIDS</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Uncle</span> Ben, I am going to ride the Pasha
out to the Pyramids," announced George, as
they were talking over their plans for a trip to
the great Pyramids of Gizeh. They had just
come in from a ride, and Nabul and Abdal were
anxiously waiting, fearful lest the tall Effendi
would say, "Well, boys, we won't need you
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean to say that when you
can either drive in a comfortable automobile or
carriage, or ride on a street-car out to the Pyramids,
that you prefer donkey back?" asked his
uncle.</p>

<p>"Indeed I do, Uncle Ben, it's lots more fun,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
said George, "besides we can ride in automobiles
and street-cars when we are home."</p>

<p>George was now quite used to riding donkey-back,
though didn't he feel tired and bumped
about the first day or two! But now he could
ride as well as the little Egyptian boys, and Nabul
had taught him how to guide the donkey by
taps with his heels; as for Teddy Pasha, he
obeyed George almost as well as he did his little
master.</p>

<p>"And Nabul, how will he get out there, run
all the way? It's some distance, you know,"
said Mr. Winthrop, smiling at the boys.</p>

<p>"No, no!" broke in Nabul eagerly, "I ride
behind the young Effendi; Teddy Pasha, he is
strong."</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle, you know how strong these little
donkeys are; they don't mind one bit carrying
two persons. When Nabul gets tired of walking
he can easily ride behind with me, can't you,
Nabul?" chimed in George.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Nabul nodded vigorously, "Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"Well, if you boys and Teddy Pasha don't
mind, it's all right," laughed Uncle Ben, "but
if you don't object, I am going to drive, so,
Abdal, I will not want you to-day, but there is a
gentleman in the hotel who wants a donkey boy,
and I have told him to take you," continued
Mr. Winthrop.</p>

<p>The boys all pulled long faces, especially
Abdal, who knew he was going to miss a good
time, for they intended to take their lunch and
stay the day.</p>

<p>"It is just as well if neither of them went,"
muttered Mustapha, "there is sure to be trouble
with the boys out there."</p>

<p>George started to ask why, but before he had
a chance Mustapha carried the boys off to make
arrangements for the morrow.</p>

<p>Little Nabul was at his usual place bright and
early the next morning, all ready for their trip
to the great Pyramids. He had a broad grin on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
his face as he peered through the railings and
"salaamed" or bowed to Mr. Winthrop and
George, who were finishing their breakfast at
one of the little tables on the terrace.</p>

<p>The Pasha, too, looked around and wriggled
his ears knowingly.</p>

<p>"He smells sugar, the rascal," exclaimed
George, who had got in the habit of giving him
sugar, and so, filling his pocket from the sugar-bowl,
he came down into the street and began
feeding it to the donkey.</p>

<p>Mustapha now came up with a small open
carriage, and they got off at once, leaving Abdal
looking very blue.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben was in the carriage and Mustapha
on the seat beside the driver, while George on
Teddy Pasha trotted along, guided by Nabul
on foot as usual.</p>

<p>Soon they were crossing the bridge across the
Nile which has two great stone lions at either
end, and then out on to a long, straight avenue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
shaded by big trees, which leads straight as an
arrow from the city of Cairo out to the Pyramids.</p>

<p>There were many people coming and going
along the great avenue. The country folks were
bringing their produce into the city to sell, and
much of it was carried on the backs of donkeys.
There were great lumbering carts drawn by
oxen, and long lines of camels, laden with such
big loads piled on their backs that they looked
like moving mountains.</p>

<p>Up to the very gates of Cairo come the great
gardens and farms which grow bountiful supplies
of vegetables and fruits, and there are even
great wheat-fields watered by the flowing Nile
and tilled by the fellaheen, or labourers, after
the same manner that the natives of Arabia,
across the Red Sea, worked in Bible times.</p>

<p>Egypt is a great and progressive and very
wealthy country, but the country folk have not
all been taught as yet how to get the best results
from their labour. They are learning rapidly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
however, and they see things in the city, when
they bring their produce to market, which please
their fancies, and now in many an Egyptian
farmhouse built of sun-baked mud, and even
in the tents of the Bedouin Arabs of the desert,
one often sees those common nickel alarm
clocks, oil lamps, and even little hand sewing-machines.</p>

<p>Amidst all this throng of country people going
citywards our friends made but slow progress.
Often the little donkeys from the country would
pass, carrying two and sometimes three big men
on their backs.</p>

<p>"See what great loads these country donkeys
have to carry," said Nabul to his donkey.
"Thou shouldst be willing to carry me for a
while," and so saying Nabul jumped up on
Teddy Pasha's broad back behind the little
American.</p>

<p>Teddy Pasha turned his head around with an
inquiring look as much as to say, "Oh, yes, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
can see you," and then drooped his ears, then
stood stock-still. Not a foot would he budge.</p>

<p>"Go on, lazy one, is this the way that thou wilt
disgrace me?" cried Nabul, beating his heels
against the Pasha. "No one will again believe
me when I praise thee! Oh, thou ungrateful
beast!" he continued, half-crying with vexation.
By this time the carriage was far ahead
and some little children wading in a pool by the
wayside began to jeer at them.</p>

<p>George remembered the sugar in his pocket
and tried to coax the Pasha with some of it. The
Pasha ate it gratefully, but that was all he would
do.</p>

<p>At this moment the boys heard some one
laugh behind them, and the jingle of donkey
bells, and who should go dashing past them but
Abdal on his donkey, Bobs!</p>

<p>The minute Pasha saw it was Bobs passing
him he got on his mettle and away he went after
him. Meantime the carriage had halted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
when the boys came up, Uncle Ben was looking
anxiously around and Mustapha was ready to
scold.</p>

<p>"Why dost thou linger?" he demanded of
Nabul, "and Abdal, why art thou not in the
city earning money instead of galloping all over
the country?"</p>

<p>"I knew well that when the Effendi reaches
the great Pyramids he will want to ride out to
see the wonderful Sphinx, and I knew, too, he
would not want to ride one of those miserable
little donkeys that one finds there, so, behold, I
am here at his service," and Abdal, quite unabashed,
smiled so sweetly at Mr. Winthrop,
that the gentleman did not have the heart to
scold him for deserting his friend at the hotel.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt have to fight, then, with the donkey
boys at the Pyramids; they will call thee a
meddler, and perhaps beat thee," called out
Mustapha ungraciously as the little procession
started on again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pouf," said Nabul, "they are only Bedouins."
The little boys who live in Cairo have
a great contempt for the Bedouins, the people
who live in the desert.</p>

<p>"Why should they object to our riding your
donkeys?" asked George, full of curiosity.</p>

<p>Nabul explained in his broken English that
there was a tribe of Bedouins who lived near the
Pyramids, who thought that they only had the
right to act as guides to the visitors who come
to see these great monuments. This was because
the men of their tribe had been doing this for
years and years; and it was thus that they resented
any one coming in and interfering with
their ancient privileges.</p>

<p>"I call that real selfish, don't you, Uncle
Ben?" exclaimed George.</p>

<p>"But they shall not fight me and Abdal, we
are your donkey boys; you ride our donkeys in
the great city, and you shall ride our donkeys
at the Pyramids; it is the same thing; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
shall not run us away," said little Nabul
stoutly.</p>

<p>"We won't let them," declared George, and
he doubled up his fists, "we'll fight first."</p>

<p>"Behold the great Pyramids!" called out
Mustapha, pointing between the trees. Sure
enough, there stood the three Pyramids, that
every child knows so well from the pictures,
rising one behind the other.</p>

<p>"They look very small," said George disappointedly.</p>

<p>"But they are big, very big, wait and you
will see," said Nabul. This was quite true. As
they rode nearer, the Pyramids seemed to grow
bigger and bigger. Now as they had come to
the end of the avenue the carriage stopped, for
only the sandy desert lay beyond.</p>

<p>Abdal had Bobs ready and Uncle Ben
mounted, and away they went up a sloping hill
toward the largest of the three Pyramids. All
around the base of this Pyramid were gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
a crowd of Egyptians, men and boys, leading
camels and donkeys. As soon as they caught
sight of the little party, this howling crowd came
rushing to meet them. A number of them
gathered around Uncle Ben and George, catching
hold of them; shouting in their own language
and in broken English, "Take me for
guide! Take me for guide!" Such a din as
they kept up was never heard anywhere else.</p>

<p>George did not know whether to laugh or to
feel frightened when two big fellows tried to pull
him off his donkey, but he held on to Teddy
Pasha for dear life, and the Pasha helped him
fend off the fellows by backing his ears and kicking
out with his heels.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nabul and Abdal were brandishing
their sticks in the faces of the Bedouins and
calling them all kinds of names, all the while
holding on tightly to the bridles of their own
donkeys. Big, fat Mustapha forgot all about
his dignity and went at the fellows, trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
push them away and shouting at the top of his
voice. In the midst of the fuss Nabul cried out:
"O Sheik, O Sheik, decide for us!" At the
same time he rushed up to a tall man with a
long gray beard and flowing white garments,
who strode up, giving the crowd of Bedouins a
whack first to one side and then to the other
with a high staff which he carried in his hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, thou ruffians, wilt thou drive the
strangers away with thy violence?" demanded
the old man, looking sternly around him, while
Mustapha explained things to him.</p>

<p>"The Sheik will make them behave now,"
said Abdal.</p>

<p>"How can he?" asked George, glad to be
free of the two Bedouins who had been pestering
him.</p>

<p>"It is the Sheik of the Pyramids, the chief of
the tribe, they must obey him," answered Nabul.</p>

<p>"Who gave them the right to guard the Pyramids?
Why can't anybody walk around here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
alone if he wants to?" persisted the American
boy.</p>

<p>"I know not, it has always been so," said
Nabul with a shrug of his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Ah! And they pay many pieces of gold as
a tax for the right," chimed in Abdal, looking
wise.</p>

<p>"They rob the travellers of money, too, the
thieves!" returned Nabul, glowering at a bunch
of donkey boys who were poking all manner of
fun at the little boys from the city, though they
did not dare to attack them while the Sheik was
around.</p>

<p>Mustapha had evidently arranged matters
with the Sheik, and came back with four of the
Bedouins whom he said would take Mr. Winthrop
and George up to the top of the great
Pyramid.</p>

<p>"Dear me, I certainly don't need two big
men to help me climb up there," exclaimed
George. "Why, it must be as easy as can be to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
climb from one of those steps to another, Uncle
Ben."</p>

<p>"It's probably harder work than it looks,
just try it," answered his uncle.</p>

<p>Mustapha was going to sit in the shade and
have a friendly smoke with the Sheik, and rest
after his exertions, but he very graciously told
Nabul and Abdal that, if they wanted to, they
could leave their donkeys in his charge and
climb up with the "young Effendi."</p>

<p>Nothing loath, the little Egyptians began to
scramble up the side of the great Pyramid, calling
to George to follow, that they knew the way.</p>

<p>The Pyramids are so built that the stones
form great steps from the bottom to the top.
To George's great surprise when he got to the
first of these steps, which looked so small from the
ground, he found it was as high as he was. The
little Egyptian boys quickly hoisted themselves
up, and nothing daunted, George followed as
best he could; but after two or three of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
high steps, he was glad enough to have his two
guides take hold of his arms&mdash;one on either
side&mdash;and lift him easily from one big step to
the other. George was so out of breath that he
could not say a word, but only watch Nabul and
Abdal away ahead of him, climbing up the
great stone blocks like gazelles. The ascent
seemed to take a long time to George, but it was
really only a few minutes before the two Bedouins
lifted him over the last step. Close behind
him came his uncle, panting between his
two guides, and the little party now found themselves
on a sort of platform at the tip-top of the
great Pyramid.</p>

<p>How much could be seen from their lofty
perch! And how eager were the little Egyptians
to point out everything to the strangers!</p>

<p>There were the other two Pyramids, much
smaller than the one they stood on, which is
called the Pyramid of Cheops. On one side
stretched the great yellow desert of sand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
rocks; on the other were green fields and groups
of little Arab villages and palm-trees. That
silver ribbon running through the green fields,
way off yonder, was the great waterway of the
Nile, and there beside it was the big white city
of Cairo. They laughed as they looked down
on the guides and donkey boys far below, for
they looked like little toy figures.</p>

<p>"The Pyramids were built for tombs, weren't
they, Uncle Ben?" asked George, as they rested
and sipped tiny cups of coffee, which they
bought from a man dressed in a yellow gown
and green turban who sat beside a small brazier
of charcoal making coffee to sell to the visitors.</p>

<p>"Yes, by those old Kings of Egypt&mdash;the
Pharaohs. The stones of which they are built
were brought from great distances and put into
place by regular armies of men who worked many
long years. Even to-day there is more or less
mystery surrounding them, and strangers from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
all over the world never cease to wonder and
marvel at these curious monuments."</p>

<p>After resting awhile, our party climbed down
again, which was almost as hard work as getting
up. At the bottom the donkey boys of the Pyramids
were waiting for them again, and only the
Sheik's stern eye kept them in good order.</p>

<p>"You see that door there," said Nabul, pointing
to an opening in the base of the Pyramid;
"you can go inside if you like. It is said that
the great kings of olden times were buried in
there. That is the door to the tombs; and there
is a great room inside with pictures painted on
the walls, but oh, it is dark, I like it not," said
little Nabul, shaking his head.</p>

<p>George did not think he would like it, either,
and wanted to know where the Sphinx was.
So all mounted the donkeys again and trotted
through the sand to see the Sphinx, followed by
the disappointed Bedouin donkey boys who
finally one by one trailed off and left them in
peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/i089.jpg" width="340" height="500" alt="Boy leading boy on donkey; pyramids and sphinx in background" />
<div class="caption">AT THE PYRAMIDS.</div>
</div>
<p>"I thought the Sphinx was right beside the
Pyramids. I don't see it now," said George.</p>

<p>"It is there, the great Sphinx, see!" said
Nabul, as they turned around a hillock of sand.
Sure enough there was the big stone head sticking
up out of the sand. Nabul and Abdal
brought the donkeys to a standstill in front of it,
and the boys stood on the edge of a great pit
staring at the strange figure which has the head
of a human being and the body of a lion, and
which was carved out of the rock so long ago that
no one now knows its history.</p>

<p>"Look, the Sphinx smiles, she always smiles
like that," whispered Nabul (he called it
"Spinkie" in a funny little way). "I think
sometimes I can see her mouth move." It is
quite true that the stone lips do seem to smile.</p>

<p>"Let's climb up and whisper something in its
ear," said George. The boys ran down the sloping
sides of the great pit in which sat the Sphinx,
but to George's amazement he found that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
could not even climb up to one of the great
paws, much less the head which towered high
above them.</p>

<p>By this time they all decided that they were
very hungry, and that it would be a fine idea to
have a picnic between the paws of the great
Sphinx. So Mustapha opened the lunch basket
which he had brought, and the little party seated
themselves in the shade of the strange stone face,
and spread out the contents of the palm-leaf
basket on a big flat stone. Nabul and Abdal
had their lunch stowed away somewhere in their
garments, and they were eager that George
should taste their favourite dish of fried peppers
that&mdash;ugh!&mdash;made his mouth smart, though
he liked their sweet honey cakes. But not for
anything would the little Egyptian boys eat any
of the nice cold ham which was a part of his
lunch, for no little Mohammedan child, or grown
person either, would touch pork in any shape or
form. It was against their religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they discovered that they were very
thirsty, and Abdal ran off to find something cool
to drink, and came back with one of the vendors
of lemonade who hang around the Pyramids
selling their cool drinks. The <i>sherbutli</i>, as Abdal
called him, wore a bright red apron and carried
little blue china cups on a brass tray. These he
filled with lemonade from the big glass bottle
which was slung over his shoulder, and the children
thought nothing ever tasted nicer.</p>

<p>They rested for awhile and amused themselves
watching the people who came riding up
on camels or donkeys to see the Sphinx. Finally
Mustapha said it was time to go back to the
city, and though George stoutly declared he
wasn't a bit tired he was not really sorry when
Uncle Ben said that he had better drive back in
the carriage with him, and Teddy Pasha and
Bobs were probably glad, too, when they turned
into their stables that night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<br />
<small>BEN HASSAN'S DAHABEAH</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Nabul</span> often talked with the "little Effendi"
during their rides together, of his home and the
mother and the two little sisters, and about his
father and the dahabeah with its huge sails,
until nothing would do but George must know
them all and take a trip on the dahabeah.</p>

<p>The boys had their heads together a lot these
days, and at last it came out that it would be
a splendid plan for all of them to take a trip
up the Nile on the dahabeah of Nabul's father.</p>

<p>"Think what a treat it will be, Uncle Ben,"
said George, "to go and live on a real Egyptian
boat. Nabul's mother is going to keep house
for us on board, and the little girls will help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
her. Then, just think! we can take the donkeys,
too," continued George, warming up more
and more to his subject.</p>

<p>"Well! George, you seem to have thought
of everything," and Mr. Winthrop laughed long
and heartily. "I did not know you had such
a head for business. It does not seem a bad
idea, however, this river trip of yours; there
must be much that is interesting to be seen in
that way," continued his uncle. "I will ask
Mustapha what he thinks about it."</p>

<p>"Uncle Ben, you are a good fellow!"
exclaimed George, jumping up and hugging
his uncle, for now he would have a chance to
see something of the real life of the country
such as the tourists who stayed only in the
cities never had.</p>

<p>Mustapha was very bland and gracious when
he found out that he was expected to go along,
too. He said that Ben Hassan, Nabul's father,
was a good friend of his, that there was no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
skilful captain nor better dahabeah on the
Nile than his, and that everything could be
arranged as they wished.</p>

<p>Nabul was a happy little boy the day he
guided these wonderful Americans, as he
always thought of them, to his home. There
they met Nabul's father, a tall, grave man of
few words. While he and Uncle Ben talked the
trip over (with Mustapha as interpreter, though
Ben Hassan knew some English), Mizram
the mother gave them coffee served in tiny cups
without handles, each set in a brass holder,&mdash;the
thick Turkish coffee which is all grounds
and sugar which one gets in Egypt. Then the
two little sisters crept in to see the kind people
their brother had talked so much about. Menah,
who was the eldest, was rather shy and quiet,
but Zaida was a roguish, merry little soul who
made friends easily. They did not know a
word of English, but by smiles and gestures
they made friends with George and showed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
all their treasures. There was the big white
cockatoo who swung on his perch and could
talk, and a cage of small singing birds that
Abdal's father had sent them.</p>

<p>And the little girls had some dolls of which
they were very proud. The dolls were queer
little figures, fashioned after those which had
been dug up from old tombs where they had
been buried for centuries. There were odd
little stone and clay figures, too, which the girls
treasured quite as much as they did the dolls
in human form. One was in the form of a Nile
crocodile, another of a buffalo and another of
a lion, and still others in the form of goats,
camels, and donkeys. There was another doll
in the form of a man carrying a great basket
on his shoulder and another of a washerwoman.</p>

<p>The custom of little Egyptian children playing
with these dolls and figures is very old&mdash;for
all the world their dolls are like the Noah's
Ark animals which you have at home&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
ages and ages ago, when little children died,
their dolls were always buried with them.</p>

<p>After the call upon Nabul's family everybody
trooped down to the river to see the <i>Isis</i>, which
was the name of Ben Hassan's dahabeah, and
Mr. Winthrop agreed with George that it was
just the thing they would both like, so it was
all arranged on the spot without further ado,
and it was decided that they would start on the
voyage up-river the following week.</p>

<p>Finally the day came to set sail. It was indeed
a busy morning for the family of Ben Hassan!
Baskets and pots and pans and jars and sacks
of clothing and household belongings of all
kinds were loaded on to Teddy Pasha and
Bobs, who must have wondered to themselves
what was going to happen. At last everything
had been thought of, Nabul's mother gave the
last directions to the friends whom Abdal lived
with who were to look after the house and the
fowls and the birds while they were away, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
amid good-byes from the neighbours, who
were all at their windows and doors to see them
off, the little procession started down to the
river landing where lay the dahabeah.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/i099.jpg" width="345" height="500" alt="people on shore in front of sailboat" />
<div class="caption">THE DAHABEAH.</div>
</div>
<p>"Hurry up, lazy one," cried Abdal, "thou
wilt have plenty of time to rest," as he hurried
Bobs along with a tap from his stick.</p>

<p>"Thou dost not go that way to-day," said
Nabul, giving Teddy Pasha's bridle a jerk as
he started to turn down his habitual street.
"Thou goest on a longer journey to-day."
And the two little donkeys put their heads
together as if to discuss this unusual proceeding.</p>

<p>When they got to the dahabeah everybody
was bustling about, putting the boat in order for
the voyage. Nabul's father was standing on the
little upper deck giving orders to some of the
crew who were looking to the ropes and sails,
while others were scrubbing the deck. Here
and there were piled up all sorts of things,
gaily painted wooden boxes, which are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
kind of trunks Egyptians use, baskets of eatables,
live chickens, and big water-jars.</p>

<p>Everybody was talking and shouting all at
once in the usual Egyptian fashion. Mizram,
however, at once set to work to get things
straightened out, and the little girls helped her
as best they could.</p>

<p>In the midst of it all the carriage drove up with
Mr. Winthrop and George and their baggage,
with Mustapha beside the driver. George was
standing up waving his cap, and was out of
the carriage before it stopped. He rushed up
the gang-plank and on to the deck, and insisted
on shaking hands with everybody, beginning
with the reis, as a Nile captain is named, and
ending with the boy washing down the deck.
Every one was greatly surprised, for Egyptians
don't known anything about shaking hands
in our way. Their ceremonies of politeness
are quite as marked, but very different, as,
for instance, a kiss on the forehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Mustapha was in his element,
storming about and calling on the great Prophet
Mohammed to bear witness that they would
never be able to get off with such a crew of
dullards.</p>

<p>"As for me I am going to get out of the way
by going on the upper deck, it seems to be
the only quiet place on board," said Uncle Ben,
as he dodged the chickens and took refuge on
the elevated stern of the boat where the grave,
stately reis gave him a deep salaam of welcome.</p>

<p>Urged on by Mustapha's threats, the little
crew soon began to get things in order. The
tug of war came when it was time for the
donkeys to come aboard. The boys got them
up to the plank, but there they just planted
their feet down firmly and not another step
would they budge. They weren't going to
leave dry land. Nabul coaxed and pulled,
and Abdal clucked and prodded, but all Teddy
Pasha did was to back his ears and give an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
awful bray, which made the crowd of loafers
gathered on the river bank laugh. Finally
Nabul tied a cloth over the Pasha's head, and
while he pulled hard at the bridle in front Abdal
tweaked the little donkey's tail, and this made
him so mad that he dashed up the plank and
on to the deck before he knew it, and just as
soon as Bobs saw him go he rushed aft. The
donkeys were then led triumphantly to their
quarters in the prow of the boat, where they
were very comfortable and content. George
at once christened this part of the boat "the
menagerie," for the chickens were already there
pecking away at some grain, each fastened to
the railing by a long string tied around one leg
to keep them from flying overboard. The
little girls, too, had brought the big white
cockatoo to keep them company, and his wooden
cage hung against the side of the cabin, while
curled up in a tight box was a tame snake
belonging to one of the crew. The Egyptians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of all ages and all classes are very fond of
pets.</p>

<p>George was as excited and happy as could
be as he rushed about with the children from
one end of the boat to the other.</p>

<p>"Isn't it funny to see sailors in long white
gowns and turbans on their heads, Uncle Ben?"
laughed George. "How can they ever climb
up the rigging in clothes like that?"</p>

<p>"But they don't have any rigging to climb,
on a dahabeah, they only have to shift a rope
once and again," said Mr. Winthrop.</p>

<p>There was a large sail in the bow and a
much smaller one in the stern, each of them
of the great pointed lateen variety seen on
the rivers and along the coasts of all Mediterranean
countries. The boat itself was a sharp-prowed,
broad-bottomed affair which seemed
to glide over the water rather than through it.
The Nile dahabeahs are among the most picturesque
boats afloat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>In the stern, on the lower deck, were two
small cabins for Uncle Ben and George, and
a little saloon to eat in. Further forward was
the kitchen and storeroom, and beyond these the
quarters for the reis's family and Mustapha.</p>

<p>"We sleep on the deck," said Nabul. "Abdal
and I just roll up in a blanket and lie down on
the deck boards, and sleep just like the crew."</p>

<p>"I should like to do that, too; it must be
lots more fun than sleeping in a stuffy little
cabin," exclaimed George, much interested.</p>

<p>"It's hard if you aren't used to it, but we
think nothing of doing so," said Abdal.</p>

<p>At last the friends who had come down to
see them off had taken their leave, and the gang-plank
was drawn in, the sails unfurled, and two
of the men seized a couple of big oars and pushed
off the prow from the bank. Slowly the dahabeah
swung over to the middle of the stream;
the crowd on shore shouted a last farewell;
the breeze caught and filled the big sails, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in a few minutes they were gliding swiftly
through the muddy brown water of the Nile,
up river toward the very heart of the "dark
continent" of Africa.</p>

<p>On the upper deck Mustapha had just put
two long wicker chairs for the "Effendis,"
and Uncle Ben, who had picked up a little
Arabic, was comfortably stretched out in one
trying to talk with the reis, who sat beside him
on a rug spread on the deck smoking his big
"hubble-bubble" pipe, every once in awhile
giving an order to one of the crew as they
trimmed the sails to catch all the breeze.</p>

<p>Mats were spread on the decks for the others;
the children, however, were too busy to think
of sitting down; they kept running from one
side to the other, watching the houses and people
on the banks as they slipped past, and the queer
craft going and coming on the river.</p>

<p>"There come three nuggars," said Abdal,
pointing to three broad, flat, barge-like boats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
each with a high lateen sail, coming slowly
toward them.</p>

<p>"What a funny name! what are 'nuggars'?"
asked George.</p>

<p>"Nuggars are the great Nile cargo boats
which carry all kinds of merchandise up and
down the river," said Nabul. "See the great
boxes and bales on that one," he continued.</p>

<p>"And the one behind has a lot of oxen and
sheep on it; they are loaded down to the water's
edge, I wonder they don't sink," said George.
"Oh! And here come three haystacks floating
down-stream! With sails on top of them, too!"
he cried.</p>

<p>But no, they too were boats, this time loaded
with fodder and the long green bamboos which
were being carried to the city. Then a ferryboat
filled with people and donkeys crossed the
river ahead of them, rowed by men in dark
blue cotton gowns. It was all so novel and
amusing the children were almost sorry to stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
looking in order to eat lunch, though George
did say he was hungry enough to eat a hippopotamus.</p>

<p>One of the men brought a table and noiselessly
set it on deck for the "Effendis," and then
served them the nice things that Mizram had
cooked. There was chicken with a nice hot
pepper sauce and rice and all kinds of vegetables
and melons and dates and oranges.</p>

<p>At the other end of the deck the reis and his
family and Mustapha had their meal. Mizram
served them all sorts of queer dishes that the
little Egyptians kept on bringing to the "Effendi"
to taste; and how they laughed at the
faces the little American made over some of
them!</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'After Al-Ghada, rest, if it be but for two moments;<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">After Al-Asha, walk, if it be but two steps,'"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>said Mustapha, quoting one of their proverbs
as he stretched himself on a rug for a nap after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
dinner. <i>Al-Ghada</i> is dinner and <i>Al-Asha</i> is
supper.</div>

<p>"Nabul, what is in that bag?" asked George,
pointing to a big brown bag which hung on the
side of the mast of the dahabeah, and which one
of the men was just taking down.</p>

<p>"It is the food of the crew. They put it
there so that all can see it and no one can steal
any of it without his fellows seeing him. The
crew are going to eat their dinner now," explained
Nabul, "and that fellow there has just
climbed up and unhooked it."</p>

<p>By this time the sun was beating down hotly
on the canvas awning over the deck, and one by
one everybody followed Mustapha's advice,
except the men on duty. The little Egyptian
children, curled up on their mats, were soon
sound asleep. George stoutly declared that he
was not going to miss anything by sleeping.
Mr. Winthrop had brought a book that told
all about Egypt, and George listened while his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
uncle read aloud about Memphis, which they
would soon pass. Thousands of years ago it
had been another burial-place, when the haughty
Pharaohs reigned in Egypt. But the first thing
that George knew, he had forgotten all about
the Pharaohs, and woke with a start in his big
chair by the rattle of the sails as they were
dropped, while the dahabeah gently glided to the
landing-place, where the reis was to deliver
some merchandise which he had brought up
to a dweller on the bank from a Cairo dealer in
ironware.</p>

<p>From the landing-place on the river the
party had time to take a ride inland, and Nabul
and Abdal had the donkeys all ready as soon
as the gangplank was pushed out. There was
no trouble in getting the little donkeys off the
boat. The minute they saw the dry land they
made a dash for the shore. And weren't the
donkey boys on the landing mad when they saw
that the strangers had brought their own donkeys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
They howled and shouted, and wanted
to know how the Cairo donkeys could be expected
to carry the visitors through the sand and
rough soil hereabouts.</p>

<p>However, they felt better when Mustapha
picked out two of their donkeys,&mdash;one for
himself and the other for the two little girls,&mdash;grumbling
at the same time something about
"too many children," but as Nabul whispered
to Abdal, "Mustapha was like an old camel
with a hard mouth and a soft heart."</p>

<p>The little girls were wild with delight that
they were going, too. Menah sat with her
feet hanging over one side and Zaida behind her
with her feet dangling down the other side of
the little donkey.</p>

<p>Away went the little procession, the donkeys
kicking up a cloud of dust. The road wound
through fields of grain, and along the roadside
were to be seen children guarding cows and
goats and other animals, who shouted merry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
greetings to our little friends as they passed by.</p>

<p>It was not long before Mustapha, who was
riding ahead, called out, "Now you can see
the village, there between the palms," at the
same time pointing with his cane&mdash;which a
dragoman is never without&mdash;to a large grove
of palm-trees they were approaching and
amongst which were huddled a lot of queer flat-roofed
houses.</p>

<p>"I don't see anything but big stones," said
George.</p>

<p>"Let's see who gets there first," cried Nabul;
and giving the donkeys a tap away the boys
raced, the Pasha being the first to come to a
halt beside the palm-trees.</p>

<p>"Now I can see that one of the stones is a
house, Uncle Ben," cried George as they drew
up closer.</p>

<p>There were some natives standing on the
little landing of the minaret of the mosque,
which no village hereabouts is without, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
it be large or small, and the children lost no
time in following their example and climbing
up the crazy stairs which wound around inside
the slim tower.</p>

<p>The view round about was wonderfully varied.
On one side stretched away the sandy desert,
where the Bedouin shepherds guarded their
flocks of goats, leading them from one little
oasis to another, wherever they could find
enough herbage to make a meal. On the other
side was the flowering river-bottom of the Nile,
one of the richest agricultural regions in the
world.</p>

<p>Just beside the mosque was a great grove of
date palms, and George thought it very strange,
and very much to his liking, too, that he could
reach out his hand just beyond the gallery
railing and pick the golden dates. "How I
should like to come up here every day," he said
as they made their way down to the ground.</p>

<p>Just before the entrance to the mosque was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
great stone statue which astonished George
and his uncle very much. The natives, too,
evidently had a great regard for it, as they
had planted a lot of low-growing, flowering
trees all about it, sheltering it as if it were in a
bower.</p>

<p>"How long do you suppose it has been here,
Uncle Ben?" asked George, as he took his
seat on the broad foot of the big statue.</p>

<p>"A long, long time, certainly, my boy,"
replied his uncle, "perhaps thousands of years."</p>

<p>After admiring the great statue awhile longer
they discovered Mustapha sitting on the shady
terrace of a coffee shop. He was drinking another
of those little cups of muddy-looking,
sweetish Turkish coffee of which the Egyptians
are so fond. Uncle Ben, too, liked it very much,
for it was usually made of the purest of Mocha
coffee which comes from the other side of the
Red Sea not far away from Egypt, so he too
stopped for a cup, the boys meanwhile wandering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
off with the little girls quite by themselves.</p>

<p>When they all got back to the coffee shop
again each of the children had a little wicker
cage or basket in which was imprisoned a
chameleon, a queer little beast like a lizard,
which lives by catching flies and insects.</p>

<p>The Egyptians have a superstition that to
have a chameleon in the house is almost as
good as having a cat&mdash;and they are very fond
of cats, too. The cat catches rats and mice
and the chameleon gathers in all the stinging
bugs and insects and flies. This chameleon is
thus a very useful little animal indeed. When
frightened it changes the colour of its skin
instantaneously in a most remarkable manner.
It takes on quite a different colour from what
it had a moment before. If it is lying on a green
leaf it becomes a green colour so like the leaf
it can hardly be seen, or if on the yellow sand or
a gray stone it becomes yellow or gray in turn.
The children had bought the chameleons for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
few small coins from some native boys whose
acquaintance they had made in their stroll
about the village.</p>

<p>Mustapha finally called out that they must
go on if they wanted to get back to the boat
before dark.</p>

<p>The next morning George was awakened at
daybreak by a funny sort of singing and a great
clucking of poultry. He dressed himself quickly
and ran out on deck. The crew had cast off
from the moorings, and as the big sail was
being hoisted the sailors sang a slow, monotonous
chant with the words, "Pray, pray to
Mohammed!" as a sort of chorus. In a few
minutes the dahabeah was again under way.</p>

<p>From the "menagerie" still came a clucking
of distressed hens, a snorting and braying of
donkeys, mingled with the shouts of children.</p>

<p>"What can be the matter?" thought George
as he hurried to the forward end of the
boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>There a funny sight met his eyes! The pet
snake had, by some means or other, wriggled
itself out between the slats of its box during the
night and eaten one of the hens, and now lay
gorged and drowsy on the deck, raising its
head occasionally to give a feeble hiss at the
other chickens, who were clucking and fluttering
about at the ends of their cords, frightened out
of what few wits a chicken has.</p>

<p>Nabul and Abdal were doing their best to
pacify the donkeys, who showed that they
didn't like snakes either, by trying to back over
the side of the boat.</p>

<p>The cockatoo was swinging on his perch with
every feather standing on end, while Menah
and Zaida stood huddled together on top of a
box, though they knew that the snake could
not bite as his fangs had been taken out.</p>

<p>In the middle of the commotion was Mustapha,
angrily scolding the sailor who owned
the snake and who was cringing and bowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
before the dragoman, making all sorts of excuses
for his snake.</p>

<p>"Do we buy fowls to feed thy snake?"
demanded Mustapha angrily. "Thou shalt
pay the price of the chicken."</p>

<p>"Indeed, it was a fine fat hen and cost several
piastres," put in Mizram.</p>

<p>The sailor meanwhile was putting the sleepy
snake back into its box, calling it an "ingrate"
and a "heartless viper" for thus causing its
master so much trouble.</p>

<p>"What a lot of talk over one chicken,"
laughed George when he was telling his uncle
about it. But this is just the way these people
go on over small things.</p>

<p>When things quieted down breakfast was
served on deck, after which the children hung
on the railings and enjoyed watching the many
things of interest on the shores as the strong
northerly breeze carried the dahabeah swiftly
along. Sometimes they passed so near the shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that they could call to the little brown children
paddling along the water's edge, who would
answer back greetings, and hold out their hands
and call out, "Backsheesh, give us backsheesh,"
which meant they wanted pennies
thrown to them.</p>

<p>Menah and Zaida were much interested in a
group of girls who had brought their big copper
pots and water-jars down to the edge of the
river, and were scrubbing them while they
chatted together, after which they would fill
the jars with water and balancing them on their
heads go gaily singing back to their homes.</p>

<p>"See the fisherman yonder, he is about to
throw his net," cried Abdal, pointing to a man
who stood on the high bank with a large net
gathered up in his arms. With a swing of his
arms the man skilfully flung the net out into the
river. It spread out into a great circle as it
touched the water. The boys explained to
George how it was weighted with stones, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
as it slowly sank to the bottom it would imprison
the fish so they could not get away.
One has to be very skilful to do that, they said.</p>

<p>Sometimes the children would all gather
around Mustapha and listen to his wonderful
tales. How when he was young he took long
journeys on camel-back far south in the great
Lybian Desert, which they could see stretching
away on their right. Once, too, he had there
killed a lion which had chased him, and there
were still lions to be found there, but not so
many as there used to be. When he told them
how he had seen crocodiles basking in the sun on
the river banks, not so very far from Cairo, the
children clapped their hands and wanted to
know if they weren't going to see some crocodiles.</p>

<p>"And hippopotamuses, too?" asked George.
But Mustapha shook his head and said he
thought not, that there was so much traffic and
so many steamboats and other craft on the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
now that these animals had been frightened
away and were only found now in the Upper
Nile, far beyond where they were going. This
disappointed the boys very much.</p>

<p>Then again to while away the time the little
Egyptians would show George how to play
their games, while George in turn would attempt
to teach them some of the American children's
games.</p>

<p>On several occasions the sailor brought his
tame snake on the upper deck and showed them
all the wonderful tricks his pet could do. The
snake would follow him all around the deck,
holding its head erect and waving it about as
if it liked the queer little tune the man whistled.
The sailor offered to let the snake wrap itself
around the boys' arms, but they would not
agree to this, though they thought it amusing
enough to watch its tricks with its master.</p>

<p>Everybody was so much amused by the snake's
tricks that Mustapha amiably told the sailor he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
would not have to pay for the chicken it had
eaten.</p>

<p>Abdal had been telling the "little Effendi"
so much about his home in the country that
George was anxious to see an Egyptian
farm.</p>

<p>So the boys talked it over with Mustapha,
and as the farm was not far from the river
Mustapha said it would be possible to stop off
there for a day or so on their way back.</p>

<p>Mustapha then busied himself all one day
writing a letter to Abdal's father, saying that
he and his party would stop at his farm and
telling him what day the dahabeah would be
at his landing, that he might make preparations
to welcome the American Effendis.</p>

<p>George wondered how Mustapha was going
to send the letter, but just then a big "steam
dahabeah" passed them coming down the
river crowded with a lot of tourists. The
reis said this was their chance to send back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Mustapha's letter. So he hailed it and as it
slowed down he ordered several of his crew
to launch the small boat which the dahabeah
carried. This they did, and rowing over to the
steamer threw the letter on board as she steamed
past them. So George thought there was some
use after all for a steamboat on the Nile, though
it did seem out of place and not at all as comfortable
and picturesque way of travelling as
by a sailing vessel.</p>

<p>It was always a great event for the children
when the boat was tied up near some little
village in order to lay in a new stock of provisions,
to get some grain to carry further on, or
to deliver some which they had brought from
Cairo. They would all go on shore and it was
great fun watching the people who came from
near-by farms bringing vegetables and fruits
and fowls to sell. They crowded around
Mustapha, who did the bargaining, shouting
in a high voice the prices of their wares. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
each landing they always found the water-sellers
who refilled the big water-jars on board, from
the goat-skin water-bags slung by a strap over
their shoulders. All the little children came
trooping down from the neighbouring villages
to stare shyly at the strangers, often hiding
half-afraid behind their mother's gowns; but
whether they were shy or bold, all of them
would hold out their hands for backsheesh;
even the babies perched on their mothers'
shoulders held out their little hands, though
they could not speak a word.</p>

<p>"'Tis the strangers who have spoiled them,"
Mustapha said as he drove away a crowd of
little children who were pestering George at
one little village. "They throw coins to the
little ones on the banks as they go past on the
great steamers; they mean it kindly, but it
teaches our little Egyptian children to beg and
that makes them bad," and the fat dragoman
scowled at the village children until they shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
in their little slippers and ran away as fast as
possible.</p>

<p>As they went farther up the river the green
fields grew fewer and fewer and the yellow
sand of the deserts on both sides came nearer
and nearer the river.</p>

<p>One morning the <i>Isis</i> rounded a sharp bend
in the river and there in the distance were a
group of tall columns, rising from the bank
surrounded by houses and trees.</p>

<p>"'Tis Luxor, the site of the most wonderful
ruins in all Egypt," said Mustapha with pride.</p>

<p>Everybody crowded eagerly forward while
Mustapha pointed out the places of interest.
First came the part of the town where the Egyptians
live and then the great hotels and gay
shops, and finally, just at noon, our dahabeah
pushed its high prow in among a lot of other
dahabeahs and smaller craft, and tied up
alongside the old temple with its row of a hundred
tall columns which towered high above
them on the river bank.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<br />
<small>AN EGYPTIAN FARM</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> little folks and the donkeys as well were
wild to get on shore again and stretch their
legs a bit, for they had not left the boat for
several days. As soon as they could get away
from the boat they scampered off past the big
hotels where many tourists were sitting on the
verandas and in the gardens sipping cool drinks
just as they did at Cairo.</p>

<p>Everywhere George and his uncle were
followed around by people who wanted to sell
them relics which they said they had found in
the ancient ruins,&mdash;coins and scarabs and
pottery, and all sorts of odd things. Mustapha
waved them all away. "Their antiquities are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
only make-believes," he said, with contempt.
"There are people who make these imitations,
and these fellows make a business by selling
them to travellers as real curiosities. Sometimes
there were real treasures that could be
picked up at a bargain, but not so many as in
the old days," said Mustapha.</p>

<p>Sun-up next morning found our little party
riding out on another excursion. Mizram
had packed many good things to eat in a big
palm-leaf basket covered over with green leaves
to keep the things cool, and this was slung across
Teddy Pasha's broad back. Our friends were
to have a picnic among some riverside ruins.</p>

<p>Soon they were riding between two rows of
stone figures; an avenue of Sphinxes, like the
great Sphinx at the Pyramids, only much
smaller, and in a few minutes more all dismounted
at the entrance to a great temple.</p>

<p>Such a rabble surrounded them! Beggars
clamouring for backsheesh, people wanting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
guide them through the ruins, and vendors of
relics. Mustapha and the boys had to use their
sticks freely to make the crowd stand back.</p>

<p>Two donkey boys promised to look after
the donkeys, so after threatening them with
all sorts of dire punishments if any harm should
come to their animals, Nabul and his cousin
ran after their little American friend.</p>

<p>For several hours Mustapha led his little
band in and out among the great columns and
across the broad courts of ancient temples.
There seemed to be thousands of these columns,
some standing in long rows, others lying broken
on the ground. How the children stared at the
pictures painted on the walls by the old Egyptians,
the colours as fresh as if they had just
been painted. Mustapha showed them how
these pictures made a regular story-book, if one
only knew how to read them. Here were a lot
of pictures that told all about the doings of
one of the Pharaohs,&mdash;how he went to war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and the battles he fought. There were other
pictures showing how he went hunting, and the
various kinds of animals and birds he had
brought back with him from the chase.</p>

<p>The children thought it was most amusing to
read a story-book like that, and went about
trying to make up stories for themselves out of
the pictures.</p>

<p>They stopped to watch a number of men hard
at work among the ruins lifting a fallen stone
column. More than three hundred Egyptians
were working to set up the fallen columns and
clear away the rubbish, and they worked in
much the same way as did the ancient Egyptians
who built the same temples. There were many
young boys, too, helping to pull on the long
ropes by which the columns were raised.</p>

<p>"Come, let us hunt and perhaps we can find
some relics for ourselves," said Nabul. "One of
the donkey boys last year found a little statue."</p>

<p>"I would like to find a mummy," exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
George, as the boys went to work prodding
in the sand with their sticks.</p>

<p>"Mummies are too heavy to carry away,"
said Abdal, wisely shaking his head.</p>

<p>"I should like to find a doll," whispered
Menah to her sister as they too turned over
the sand in their little fingers, thinking of her
own curious little dolls at home fashioned
after the same manner as those frequently
found among the ruins. "You remember the
great traveller who went with our father in the
dahabeah to some old city? How he had
many men to dig in the sand for him, and how
they found many wonderful things there?
Well, he said that often the dolls and toys that
were put in a little girl's tomb would be made
of gold and silver," replied Menah. "I should
like a doll of real gold to play with."</p>

<p>Pretty soon the children tired of their search
and stretched themselves out in the shade of an
enormous stone column to rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Our party made many excursions to see
many other old ruins, and one day Mustapha
took them to see some funny camel races. It
was the queerest thing in the world to see the
long-legged camels come swinging along, covering
yards and yards of ground at each step,
each camel ridden by an Arab in flowing white
dress and head covering. After this there was
a race among the donkey boys. Nabul and
Abdal were wild to join in this, but found
it was against the rules for outsiders to
enter.</p>

<p>"They are jealous, they know we could beat
these up-country donkeys," Nabul consoled
himself with saying, but he hurrahed with
everybody else all the same when a lively little
gray donkey, ridden by a small boy in a green
dress, reached the goal first and got the
prize.</p>

<p>One morning early found the <i>Isis</i> again
sailing up the river toward Assouan and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Great Cataract, which was to be their last
stopping-place.</p>

<p>When George and Uncle Ben arrived at
Assouan it was market-day, and the square by
the riverside was filled with all sorts of queer
people and things.</p>

<p>For centuries lower Egypt had been periodically
flooded and then dried out again, and the
poor native farmers and fellaheen had suffered
greatly, many, many thousands even dying of
starvation. All the great volume of water in the
river Nile became at certain seasons a mere
trickling rivulet.</p>

<p>In late years a plan whereby all lower Egypt
was to be properly watered and drained has
made even the poorest of the labourers of the
countryside happy and prosperous. This great
benefit was brought about by the building of
a great dam just above Assouan, and as the
water was let through little by little in the dry
season, and properly stored up when it flowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in abundance, it proved to be just the treatment
that was needed to make an otherwise suffering
people quite contented with their lot.</p>

<p>"I want to see the great Assouan dam,"
said George one morning as he and Uncle
Ben were just finishing their breakfast. George
was a most inquiring little fellow, and he had
heard some men talking of this great work at the
hotel, and he wanted to see for himself what it
really was.</p>

<p>George had become so expert with donkeys,
that Uncle Ben called him <i>his</i> little donkey boy.
Soon all was ready and Mustapha headed the
little procession that made its way quickly
along through clouds of dust and began struggling
over a stony desert road.</p>

<p>Little Menah was riding behind George and
Mustapha had been gracious enough to let
Zaida sit behind him. The reason of this was
that the donkey boys on the quay, who were a
lot of wild young fellows from the desert, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
come to blows among themselves as to which
of their number should go with our party
to supply the two extra donkeys required,
whereupon Mustapha said he wouldn't have
any of them, that they were a set of black
heathens anyway,&mdash;for some were little negro
boys from the Soudan,&mdash;so he borrowed a
donkey from a friend of his for himself, and
divided up the party in this way.</p>

<p>Mustapha was so big and fat and his donkey
so small that poor little Zaida had scarcely any
room to sit comfortably. George could hear
Menah shaking with laughter at her sister's
efforts to keep from slipping off at every bounce
the donkey gave.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mustapha, quite unconscious that
they were amused at him, was gravely telling
them that the high wall of bricks which followed
their road was the old-time boundary to Egypt
and was built to keep back the hordes of barbarians
from the south, but now Egypt was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
much greater country and went far beyond this
wall.</p>

<p>Soon they came into a little village on the
bank of the river which spread out here like a
lake. The children laughed when they dismounted
and looked at each other. They were
so covered with dust that the brown little
Egyptians looked white. They shouted and
clapped their hands with glee when Mustapha
told them to get into a big boat painted with the
brightest colours. Six tall black Soudanese,
dressed in white, with red fezes, pulled at the
oars, keeping time to a queer sort of chant. The
children were so busy watching the rowers
that, before they knew it, they were gliding
past a tiny temple that seemed to be rising out
of the water.</p>

<p>"This is the ancient temple of Philæ, one
of the most beautiful in Egypt," said Mustapha.
"It is on an island, but since the great
dam of Assouan was built the island itself is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
covered by water, and if the dam is raised still
higher, as they talk of doing, the little temple
will be entirely covered with water, or perhaps
destroyed, which would be a pity."</p>

<p>On arriving at the great dam they got into
another boat which took them over the First
Cataract, or waterfall, on the Nile. Not over
the worst part of it by any means, but quite
"scary" enough for the little girls. Shortly
after they were again back at Assouan.</p>

<p>George would have liked to have kept on up
the river to the city of Khartoum, where there
is a great school or college erected as a memorial
to General Gordon, who opened up and first
introduced outside civilization into these parts,
but their plans would not permit of spending the
extra time. To-day this magnificent school is
filled with intelligent, hard-working Egyptian
boys who, when they leave college and go out
among their fellows, do much to benefit and
lift them from the ignorance and superstition
which formerly existed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>So the <i>Isis</i> was headed for home, and the good
dahabeah raced along, borne by the strong
current of the river, as if it knew it was on its
way home. The happy days passed quickly and
our little friends had many adventures of which
there is not time to tell you.</p>

<p>As they came to the wide fertile country above
Cairo, and neared Abdal's home, the children
were on a sharp lookout, and Abdal was wondering
who would come down to the river to meet
them. When the <i>Isis</i> did run her sharp prow
into the bulrushes at the little landing-place
for the farm of Abdal's father, where Mustapha
proposed to stop, not only were all of
Mustapha's friends there, but most of the villagers
besides, and they all gave the visitors
the heartiest of welcomes. There was Abdal's
father and mother and the baby, and his little
brother, who kissed him on both cheeks, and
each in turn took the hand of each visitor, kissing
his own hand at the same time, a pretty little
custom among these people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>After the actual landing Uncle Ben and
George mounted the donkeys, and followed
by the others on foot, all talking and in the
highest spirits, they rode for some distance
through great fields of cotton and rice until
they came to a little village nestled away in the
midst of palm-trees.</p>

<p>Here they stopped at Abdal's father's house,
which was the biggest in the village, for Ali-Hijaz
was the chief man of the little village and
had many "fellaheen," or labourers, working
in his cotton, rice, and cane fields.</p>

<p>Ali-Hijaz's house, like all the houses in the
village, was built of mud bricks, which had first
been baked by the sun; it was thatched with
palm-leaves, and the trunks of palm-trees
strengthened the walls and formed the rafters.
Their host invited them into a large room,
where they all seated themselves on mats
spread on the hard earthen floor. While Ali-Hijaz
offered Mr. Winthrop a long-stemmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
pipe to smoke, Abdal and Nabul ran to the
little Arab café of the village and soon came
back bringing a big metal tray on which were a
number of small cups and tiny tin pots of coffee.
This was put in the middle of the floor and each
person was served with a cup and one of the
little pots of coffee. Menah and Zaida amused
themselves playing with the baby, while their
two mothers gossiped together, and George
made friends with Abdal's little brother Amad,
whom he thought looked very cunning in his
white cotton gown and little turban stuck on
his clean-shaven head.</p>

<p>"Just think, Uncle Ben," laughed George,
"he can barely walk and yet he goes to the village
school at <i>five</i> o'clock in the morning and stays
till sundown, only coming home for dinner in the
middle of the day. Whew! but that's hard
work!"</p>

<p>"And then, all he learns is to recite the Koran&mdash;the
Mohammedan Bible&mdash;at the top of his
voice," replied Mr. Winthrop.</p>

<div class="caption">"A LAZY-LOOKING OLD CAMEL WAS SLOWLY TURNING A GREAT CREAKING WOODEN WHEEL."</div>
</div>

<p>"That little mite!" said George with a
mock groan. "Well, I am glad I go to school
in America."</p>

<p>But Amad seemed to grow fat in spite of it,
and was at the head of the procession when
the children trooped out to see the village.
All the houses looked alike, with only one big
wooden door and no windows, just little slits
in the walls for air and light. Within most
of these houses there was no furniture of any
kind, save some rugs, mats, and cooking utensils,
and a few boxes made of the wood of the palm-tree,
in which to keep the family clothes. Abdal's
father had two European beds in his house
which he had brought from Cairo, but the villagers
had no use for such new-fangled things.
As they walked along all the little village children
ran out to talk to Abdal and followed them
until, as Nabul said, the procession looked like a
kite with a long tail. There were almost as
many dogs as children, and George fought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
rather shy of the fierce-looking mongrel curs
that barked at their heels.</p>

<p>Abdal took them into the fields where there
was a "sakiyeh," or water-wheel, by which the
fields are watered. A lazy-looking old camel
was slowly turning a great creaking wooden
wheel, and this turned another wheel on the
rim of which were fastened a lot of earthen jars.
These jars were filled with water as the wheel
went down into a sort of well, and as it came up
the water from the jars was emptied into a ditch
which carried it over the fields in every direction.</p>

<p>Here for the first time George saw a camel
ploughing, and such a funny plough it was!
Just a log of wood with a pointed iron tip at
one end and an upright pole at the other, by
which the ploughman could guide it.</p>

<p>When they got back to the home at sunset
they found Ali-Hijaz had persuaded Mr. Winthrop
to stay a day or two, as there was some
good bird shooting in his rice fields, a sport<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of which Uncle Ben was very fond. This
pleased the children, and that evening they had
lots of fun playing one of their games called
"Playing Pasha." They elected a "Pasha,"
and the choice fell on George, whom they put
in a kind of litter made of palm branches.
Four of their number carried this on their
shoulders while the rest ran beside carrying
lighted wisps of straw and hay for make-believe
torches. One of the boys meanwhile beat a
drum, and another played a small flute; and
thus they marched around the village until
the torches were all burned out and their mothers
called them to bed.</p>

<p>The two guests were made comfortable in
one of the beds, which were only kept for grand
occasions like this, and early the next morning
Mr. Winthrop and his host, with Mustapha,
were off to shoot rice birds.</p>

<p>"We will go and see the wild pigeons," said
Abdal, as the boys wondered how they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
amuse themselves. "I know where there are
many of them roosting in the trees."</p>

<p>"Good," answered Nabul, clapping his
hands, and the boys started off across the fields.
The Egyptian folk are very fond of the wild
pigeons of the country, and like to catch them
and keep them for pets.</p>

<p>At the same time many of the Egyptian boys,
too, are so cruel as to hunt these gentle birds,
killing them with stones which they throw
with unerring aim.</p>

<p>"Hist! they roost here," whispered Abdal
as they came to a clump of low trees. Just then
a number of pigeons flew out of the trees; at
the same time, to the great surprise of the boys,
one apparently was injured, and fell to the
ground, and Nabul ran to pick it up. Some
one had evidently injured its leg or wing. Just
then two wild, savage-looking young boys came
dashing up to Nabul crying, "Thou hast killed
one of our tame pigeons, our father shall beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
thee," trying at the same time to snatch the
bird away from Nabul.</p>

<p>"'Tis not true," returned Nabul angrily,
"dost thou think I am such a dullard as not to
know a wild pigeon from a tame one?"</p>

<p>"And I know these birds well, I have often
been here, they always roost in these trees,"
exclaimed Abdal. "I know thee, and I know
that thy pigeons are far from here."</p>

<p>The Egyptians in the country usually tame
many of these pigeons, and build them little
houses to live in on the side of their own, and
sometimes one will see a big mud tower in the
village where hundreds of these pigeons live
and build their nests.</p>

<p>In the midst of the dispute a tall man with an
ugly, scowling face strode up with a stick, so,
thinking things were getting too hot for them,
our little friends turned and fled toward the
village, Nabul, however, triumphantly holding
on to the pigeon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The other hunting party had brought back a
big bag of birds and were well pleased with the
day's work.</p>

<p>The next day they were to take leave of their
kind hosts and go back to the <i>Isis</i>. When
George awakened in the early morning, such a
wailing met his ears he could only imagine that
some one must be dead. Throwing on his
clothes he rushed down the short flight of steps
that led from his room to the big room on the
ground floor and from there into the yard.
There he saw Nabul lying face downward on the
ground beside the stable door, with his sisters
sitting beside him rocking themselves backwards
and forwards and wailing piteously,
while Abdal and the older people rushed wildly
about all talking at once.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? Nabul, are you hurt?"
cried George, rushing up to the little group.</p>

<p>"Teddy Pasha is gone, some thief has stolen
him," they all cried in one breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>It was only too true, the little donkey had
mysteriously disappeared in the night. Nabul
had got up early to get the Pasha ready for
their return to the boat. He had found the
little donkey gone, as well as his bridle and
saddle; Nabul had been looking for him ever
since and had just come back broken-hearted.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nabul, we are sure to find him! Come
and we will all look," cried George, nearly
ready to cry himself,&mdash;he had grown really
attached to his little steed.</p>

<p>Poor little Nabul lifted up a wobegone face
and slowly rose to his feet. His donkey was
like a brother to him, and he felt he would
never see him again.</p>

<p>No one thought of going back to the boat
until the little donkey was found, and the whole
village turned out to search for him.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nabul struck his forehead with his
hand. "I know now! Those two ruffian boys
we saw yesterday! 'Tis they who have stolen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
my donkey. The wretches! This is their
revenge! We will go to their house and demand
news of the Pasha," cried the distracted little boy.</p>

<p>"Follow, I know the way," said Abdal. The
boys hurried through the fields and rice swamps
until they came to a tumbled-down group of
mud huts. No one was in sight save an ugly-looking
brute of a dog and a little girl, who
peered at the strangers from behind a corner
of a wall.</p>

<p>Nabul boldly went up and shook the heavy
wooden door of the house and called loudly,
but it was tightly fastened and no one answered.
He then gave the whistle he always
used to call Teddy Pasha, but only the dog
began to bark.</p>

<p>George was for battering in the door, but the
boys said it was no use. "Teddy is not here,
or he would have answered me," sighed Nabul,
as he turned away sorrowfully, "but they
have stolen him, I am sure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"They would not dare keep him here so
near our village," replied Abdal. "They have
doubtless put him in some hiding-place far off.
That is their sister," he continued, pointing to
the little girl behind the wall. "Where art thy
brothers?" he demanded, but she only laughed
and made a face at them.</p>

<p>"She knows something," said George, making
a face in return at the child. But there was
nothing for them to do but walk away and
keep on with their search.</p>

<p>At sundown the boys returned home and poor
Nabul sat on the ground with his head buried
in his arms, refusing to be consoled. He had
eaten nothing all day, and when his mother
brought him a nice dish of curds she had made
herself, he only shook his head.</p>

<p>It was a miserable household and nobody
slept much that night. George and Abdal
refused to go to bed at all and sat beside Nabul
in the big room. Just as George was dozing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
away at daybreak he was roused up by a terrible
bray just outside the door, answered by
one from Bobs in the stable.</p>

<p>Like a flash Nabul, who had heard it too,
tore open the house door and nearly tumbled
over Teddy Pasha, who calmly walked into
the middle of the room and stood there as much
as to say, "Here I am, at last."</p>

<p>Little Nabul gave a shriek of joy and threw
his arms about the little donkey's neck and cried
and laughed in the same breath. Abdal called
out the good news, and in another moment
everybody was petting Teddy Pasha and making
as much to-do over him as if he were a long-lost
member of the family. As for the little
American, he was as happy as could be to see
the little companion of his wanderings once more.</p>

<p>But the poor little donkey, wasn't he a sight,
all covered with mud! He had evidently been
taken away and hidden in the rice swamps;
his pretty bridle and saddle were gone, and only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
a dirty and knotted piece of rope was around
his neck. An ugly cut on one of his feet showed
where he had been hobbled; his captors had
evidently done everything to keep him secure,
but in spite of it he had broken away by some
means or other, and had come straight back
to his master.</p>

<p>After leaving Abdal's family, and just as our
party were going on board the dahabeah, Nabul
picked up an odd greenish pebble. "What
a funny looking stone!" he said. "It looks
just like a beetle."</p>

<p>"That is what the learned ones call a scarab,&mdash;don't
you know there are many of these in the
big museum at Cairo?" cried Abdal, as the
children bent over the tiny stone.</p>

<p>"Oh! maybe it is old," exclaimed George
eagerly, "and worth lots and lots of money."</p>

<p>Just at that moment a party of learned looking
men, Europeans, came up the bank from their
dahabeah which had tied up just below the <i>Isis</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
At their head was a Frenchman, an inspector
of the Egyptian public monuments. With his
party he was going some miles inland to pass
judgment upon some newly discovered ruins
of which he had recently heard.</p>

<p>"Let us go and ask the great Frenchman,
he surely can tell us," and so saying, Nabul
ran back to where Mr. Winthrop and the
Frenchman were already talking together.</p>

<p>"Please, monsieur, is this old?" said Nabul,
in his queer French, holding up the little pebble
carved in the form of the sacred beetle of
the Egyptians.</p>

<p>"Eh!" said the great man, taking the
beetle in his hand. "Is it old, indeed!" he
exclaimed in great excitement. "It is a sacred
scarab. Most rare! There are only two others
like it in the world. Where did you find it,
<i>mon petit</i>?"</p>

<p>Nabul pointed out the spot where he had
found the stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Voila!</i> and to think that I have already
passed over that spot and did not know one of
the most ancient and most wonderful scarabs
known to the world was lying there!" and the
great man paced up and down, running his
hands through his hair.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon petit</i>," the Frenchman said at last,
stopping in front of Nabul, "you know the
great museum at Cairo? Well, if you will take
this little stone to the gentleman who is in
charge there, he will be very glad to have it,
and the authorities of the museum will reward
you handsomely; it is worth more than money
to them. I will give you a letter, which you
must also give to this gentleman," and so saying
the Frenchman took a pencil out of his pocket,
and, tearing a leaf out of a small blank book,
quickly wrote a few words and gave it to Nabul.
"I will write him myself at once," he continued,
"but I beg of you to guard the scarab
most carefully. I rely on you to see that he does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
not lose it," said the Frenchman, turning earnestly
to Mr. Winthrop. "It does not seem
fair to take it from him unless I at once took it
myself to Cairo, and it is impossible for me to
leave here now."</p>

<p>Mr. Winthrop and all of them promised, for
they were all now interested in the wonderful
stone, and Nabul proudly and carefully hid
it inside his embroidered vest.</p>

<p>There was a happy little party on the dahabeah
when she set sail again, and many were
the farewells to the kind people of the little
village, who all came to see them off.</p>

<p>And wasn't Teddy Pasha a spoiled and pampered
little donkey! He was petted and fed and
rubbed down by everybody on board until he
not only looked as fine and sleek as ever, but
also got so fat and lazy that Mustapha doubted
if he would ever be willing to do any more work.</p>

<p>At last the <i>Isis</i> floated up to her moorings at
Cairo, and everybody felt that they were home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
again. The first thing George did was to buy the
finest donkey saddle and bridle he could find
in Cairo and give to Teddy Pasha, who thereupon
got vainer than ever. George and his
little Egyptian friends took many more rides
together before he and Uncle Ben went back
to America. They all went together when
Nabul carried the wonderful scarab and the
Frenchman's letter to the great man in the
big museum, who talked very wisely about it.
He thanked Nabul and told him he had done
his country a service, and used a lot of long
words that the children could not understand.
But one day, not long afterward, a man in a
fine uniform came riding in great style up to
Nabul's house and gave little Nabul a sealed
packet from the authorities of the big museum,
and in it was a handsome sum of money for the
little donkey boy who found the wonderful
scarab.</p>

<p>It was enough indeed to set him up as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
dragoman when he was older, but this would
not be, Nabul promised himself, until he had
first made a visit to see his little friend, George,
in that wonderful country over the sea.</p>

<p>And thus it happened that the Little American
Cousin really did bring the good fortune to
little Nabul, the youngest donkey boy in the
big city of Cairo.</p>
